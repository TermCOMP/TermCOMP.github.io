Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 f(x) -> z | g(x) ->* h(z)
 g(a) -> h(b)
 h(b) -> g(c)
-> The system is a deterministic 3-CTRS.

Problem 1: 

2D Dependency Pair Processor:

-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 f(x) -> z | g(x) ->* h(z)
 g(a) -> h(b)
 h(b) -> g(c)

Conditional Termination Problem 2:
-> Pairs:
 F(x) -> G(x)
-> QPairs:
 G(a) -> H(b)
 H(b) -> G(c)
-> Rules:
 a -> c

The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 G(a) -> H(b)
 H(b) -> G(c)
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 f(x) -> z | g(x) ->* h(z)
 g(a) -> h(b)
 h(b) -> g(c)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(x) -> G(x)
-> QPairs:

 H(b) -> G(c)
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 f(x) -> z | g(x) ->* h(z)
 g(a) -> h(b)
 h(b) -> g(c)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

(8) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> c
   g(a) -> h(b)
   h(b) -> g(c)

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> z <= g(x) -> h(z)


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(g(x))
   U1(h(z)) -> z
   a -> c
   g(a) -> h(b)
   h(b) -> g(c)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a) = 0
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(c) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(h(x_1)) = 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x) -> U1(g(x))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U1(h(z)) -> z
   a -> c
   g(a) -> h(b)
   h(b) -> g(c)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:b > h_1 > g_1 > c > a > U1_1

and weight map:

   a=3
   c=2
   b=1
   U1_1=1
   h_1=2
   g_1=1

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(h(z)) -> z
   a -> c
   g(a) -> h(b)
   h(b) -> g(c)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

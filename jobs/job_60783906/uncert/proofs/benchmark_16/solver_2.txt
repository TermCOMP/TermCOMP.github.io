Quasi decreasingness of the given CTRS could be proven:

(0) CTRS
(1) CTRSToQTRSProof [SOUND, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 26 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) QTRS
(7) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(8) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R is empty.
The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   not(x) -> false <= x -> true
   not(x) -> true <= x -> false


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   not(x) -> U1(x)
   U1(true) -> false
   U1(false) -> true

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(false) = 0
   POL(not(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(true) = 1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(true) -> false
   U1(false) -> true




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   not(x) -> U1(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:not_1 > U1_1

and weight map:

   not_1=1
   U1_1=1

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   not(x) -> U1(x)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

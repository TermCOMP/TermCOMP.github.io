Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x)
(RULES
not(x) -> ffalse | x ->* ftrue
not(x) -> ftrue | x ->* ffalse
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 not(x) -> ffalse | x ->* ftrue
 not(x) -> ftrue | x ->* ffalse
-> The system is a 2-CTRS.

Problem 1: 

2D Dependency Pair Processor:

Conditional Termination Problem 1:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 not(x) -> ffalse | x ->* ftrue
 not(x) -> ftrue | x ->* ffalse

Conditional Termination Problem 2:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 not(x) -> ffalse | x ->* ftrue
 not(x) -> ftrue | x ->* ffalse


The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 not(x) -> ffalse | x ->* ftrue
 not(x) -> ftrue | x ->* ffalse
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 not(x) -> ffalse | x ->* ftrue
 not(x) -> ftrue | x ->* ffalse
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

(12) TRUE


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b -> c
   f(b) -> f(a)

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   a -> c <= b -> c


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> U1(b)
   U1(c) -> c
   b -> c
   f(b) -> f(a)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a) = 1
   POL(b) = 1
   POL(c) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b -> c




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> U1(b)
   U1(c) -> c
   f(b) -> f(a)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a) = 0
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(c) = 2
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(c) -> c




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> U1(b)
   f(b) -> f(a)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is 
   a -> U1(b)

The TRS R 2 is 
   f(b) -> f(a)

The signature Sigma is {f_1}
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> U1(b)
   f(b) -> f(a)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a
   f(b)


----------------------------------------

(9) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(b) -> F(a)
   F(b) -> A

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> U1(b)
   f(b) -> f(a)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a
   f(b)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(12)
TRUE

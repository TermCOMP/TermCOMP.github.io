(8) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(d, x, x) -> A
   h(x, x) -> g(x, x, f(k))
   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   b -> d
   c -> e
   c -> l
   k -> l
   k -> m
   d -> m

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> x <= x -> e


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(x, x)
   U1(e, x) -> x
   g(d, x, x) -> A
   h(x, x) -> g(x, x, f(k))
   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   b -> d
   c -> e
   c -> l
   k -> l
   k -> m
   d -> m

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A) = 2
   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(a) = 2
   POL(b) = 2
   POL(c) = 2
   POL(d) = 2
   POL(e) = 2
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(g(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = x_1 + x_2 + x_3
   POL(h(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(k) = 0
   POL(l) = 0
   POL(m) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x) -> U1(x, x)
   U1(e, x) -> x
   c -> l
   d -> m




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(d, x, x) -> A
   h(x, x) -> g(x, x, f(k))
   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   b -> d
   c -> e
   k -> l
   k -> m

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:k > h_2 > m > l > b > a > g_3 > c > e > f_1 > A > d

and weight map:

   d=1
   A=3
   k=1
   a=1
   c=1
   b=1
   e=1
   l=1
   m=1
   f_1=1
   g_3=0
   h_2=2

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   g(d, x, x) -> A
   h(x, x) -> g(x, x, f(k))
   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   b -> d
   c -> e
   k -> l
   k -> m




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

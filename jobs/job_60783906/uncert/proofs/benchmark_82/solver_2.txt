----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(s(x)) -> x
   h(s(x)) -> x

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x, y) -> g(s(x)) <= c(g(x)) -> c(a)
   f(x, y) -> h(s(x)) <= c(h(x)) -> c(a)


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(c(g(x)), x)
   U1(c(a), x) -> g(s(x))
   f(x, y) -> U2(c(h(x)), x)
   U2(c(a), x) -> h(s(x))
   g(s(x)) -> x
   h(s(x)) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(U2(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(a) = 0
   POL(c(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(g(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(h(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, y) -> U1(c(g(x)), x)
   f(x, y) -> U2(c(h(x)), x)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U1(c(a), x) -> g(s(x))
   U2(c(a), x) -> h(s(x))
   g(s(x)) -> x
   h(s(x)) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:h_1 > s_1 > U2_2 > g_1 > a > U1_2 > c_1

and weight map:

   a=1
   c_1=1
   g_1=1
   s_1=1
   h_1=1
   U1_2=1
   U2_2=1

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(c(a), x) -> g(s(x))
   U2(c(a), x) -> h(s(x))
   g(s(x)) -> x
   h(s(x)) -> x




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c -> k(f(a))
   c -> k(g(b))
   h(x) -> k(x)
   h(f(a)) -> c
   a -> b

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> g(x) <= h(f(x)) -> k(g(b))


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(h(f(x)), x)
   U1(k(g(b)), x) -> g(x)
   c -> k(f(a))
   c -> k(g(b))
   h(x) -> k(x)
   h(f(a)) -> c
   a -> b

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x) -> U1^1(h(f(x)), x)
   F(x) -> H(f(x))
   F(x) -> F(x)
   C -> F(a)
   C -> A
   H(f(a)) -> C

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(h(f(x)), x)
   U1(k(g(b)), x) -> g(x)
   c -> k(f(a))
   c -> k(g(b))
   h(x) -> k(x)
   h(f(a)) -> c
   a -> b

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x) -> H(f(x))
   H(f(a)) -> C
   C -> F(a)
   F(x) -> F(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(h(f(x)), x)
   U1(k(g(b)), x) -> g(x)
   c -> k(f(a))
   c -> k(g(b))
   h(x) -> k(x)
   h(f(a)) -> c
   a -> b

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By forward instantiating [JAR06] the rule F(x) -> H(f(x)) we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (F(a) -> H(f(a)),F(a) -> H(f(a)))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(a)) -> C
   C -> F(a)
   F(x) -> F(x)
   F(a) -> H(f(a))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(h(f(x)), x)
   U1(k(g(b)), x) -> g(x)
   c -> k(f(a))
   c -> k(g(b))
   h(x) -> k(x)
   h(f(a)) -> c
   a -> b

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = F(x) evaluates to  t =F(x)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from F(x) to F(x).

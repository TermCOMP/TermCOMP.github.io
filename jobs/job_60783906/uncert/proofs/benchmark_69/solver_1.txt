The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 G(x,x) -> H(x,x)
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 a -> d
 b -> c
 b -> d
 f(x) -> x | x ->* c
 g(x,x) -> h(x,x)
 h(x,f(x)) -> x
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

(10) TRUE


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(a)) -> g(b)
   g(a) -> b

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   h(x) -> h(g(x)) <= f(x) -> g(x)


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(x), x) -> h(g(x))
   f(g(a)) -> g(b)
   g(a) -> b

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(a) = 1
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(h(x_1)) = 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(g(a)) -> g(b)
   g(a) -> b




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(x), x) -> h(g(x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   h(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(x), x) -> h(g(x))

The signature Sigma is {h_1, U1_2}
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(x), x) -> h(g(x))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(x0)
   U1(g(x0), x0)


----------------------------------------

(7) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(x) -> U1^1(f(x), x)
   U1^1(g(x), x) -> H(g(x))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(x), x) -> h(g(x))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(x0)
   U1(g(x0), x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(10)
TRUE

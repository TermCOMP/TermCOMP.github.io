----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(0, x) -> x
   +(x, y) -> +(y, x)

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   +(x, 0) -> 0 <= x -> 0


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(x, 0) -> U1(x)
   U1(0) -> 0
   +(0, x) -> x
   +(x, y) -> +(y, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(+(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(0) = 0
   POL(U1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   +(x, 0) -> U1(x)
   U1(0) -> 0
   +(0, x) -> x




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(x, y) -> +(y, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   +(x, y) -> +(y, x)

The signature Sigma is {+_2}
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(x, y) -> +(y, x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   +(x0, x1)


----------------------------------------

(7) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   +^1(x, y) -> +^1(y, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(x, y) -> +(y, x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   +(x0, x1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   +^1(x, y) -> +^1(y, x)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   +(x0, x1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   +(x0, x1)


----------------------------------------

(12)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   +^1(x, y) -> +^1(y, x)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = +^1(x, y) evaluates to  t =+^1(y, x)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [x / y, y / x]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from +^1(x, y) to +^1(y, x).

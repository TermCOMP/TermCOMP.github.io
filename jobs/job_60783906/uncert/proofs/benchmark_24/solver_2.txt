Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   b -> d
   c -> e
   c -> l
   k -> l
   k -> m
   d -> m

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> x <= x -> e
   g(d, x, y) -> A <= y -> x
   h(x, y) -> g(x, y, f(k)) <= y -> x


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A) = 0
   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(U2(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(U3(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2 + x_1 + 2*x_2 + x_3
   POL(a) = 2
   POL(b) = 2
   POL(c) = 0
   POL(d) = 1
   POL(e) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(g(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2*x_1 + x_2 + x_3

   POL(k) = 1
   POL(l) = 0
   POL(m) = 0

   U2(x) -> A
   a -> c
   a -> d

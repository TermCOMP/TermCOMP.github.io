Quasi decreasingness of the given CTRS could be proven:

(0) CTRS
(1) CTRSToQTRSProof [SOUND, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 17 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   plus(0, y) -> y
   plus(s(x), y) -> plus(x, s(y))

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x, y) -> z <= plus(x, y) -> plus(z, z')


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(plus(x, y))
   U1(plus(z, z')) -> z
   plus(0, y) -> y
   plus(s(x), y) -> plus(x, s(y))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:s_1 > 0 > plus_2 > f_2 > U1_1

and weight map:

   0=1
   U1_1=1
   s_1=1
   f_2=1
   plus_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, y) -> U1(plus(x, y))
   U1(plus(z, z')) -> z
   plus(0, y) -> y
   plus(s(x), y) -> plus(x, s(y))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

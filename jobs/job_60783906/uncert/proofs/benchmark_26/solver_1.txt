a -> b
f(x) -> c(x,y) | g(x) ->* y, y ->* h(x)
g(a) -> h(b)
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 a -> b
 f(x) -> c(x,y) | g(x) ->* y, y ->* h(x)
 g(a) -> h(b)
-> The system is a deterministic 3-CTRS.

-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> b
 f(x) -> c(x,y) | g(x) ->* y, y ->* h(x)
 g(a) -> h(b)

Conditional Termination Problem 2:
-> Pairs:
 F(x) -> G(x)
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> b
 f(x) -> c(x,y) | g(x) ->* y, y ->* h(x)

The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> b
 f(x) -> c(x,y) | g(x) ->* y, y ->* h(x)
 g(a) -> h(b)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(x) -> G(x)
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> b
 f(x) -> c(x,y) | g(x) ->* y, y ->* h(x)
 g(a) -> h(b)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

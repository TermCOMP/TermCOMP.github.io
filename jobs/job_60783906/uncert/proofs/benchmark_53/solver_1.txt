(RULES
a -> c
a -> d
f(x) -> x | x ->* c, d ->* x
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 a -> d

Conditional Termination Problem 1:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c

 f(x) -> x | x ->* c, d ->* x

Conditional Termination Problem 2:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 a -> d
 f(x) -> x | x ->* c, d ->* x


The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 a -> d
 f(x) -> x | x ->* c, d ->* x
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 a -> d
 f(x) -> x | x ->* c, d ->* x
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

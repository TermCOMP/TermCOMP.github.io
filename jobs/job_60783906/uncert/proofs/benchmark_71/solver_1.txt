)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 a -> d
 f(x) -> z | s(x) ->* t(z)
 s(c) -> t(k)
-> The system is a deterministic 3-CTRS.

The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> c
 a -> d
 f(x) -> z | s(x) ->* t(z)
 s(c) -> t(k)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

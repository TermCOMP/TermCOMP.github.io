(RULES
f(x,y) -> x | g(x) ->* z, g(y) ->* z
g(x) -> c | d ->* c
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> x | g(x) ->* z, g(y) ->* z
 g(x) -> c | d ->* c
-> The system is a 2-CTRS.

Problem 1: 

2D Dependency Pair Processor:

Conditional Termination Problem 1:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> x | g(x) ->* z, g(y) ->* z
 g(x) -> c | d ->* c

Conditional Termination Problem 2:
-> Pairs:
 F(x,y) -> G(x)
 F(x,y) -> G(y) | g(x) ->* z
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> x | g(x) ->* z, g(y) ->* z
 g(x) -> c | d ->* c


The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> x | g(x) ->* z, g(y) ->* z
 g(x) -> c | d ->* c
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(x,y) -> G(x)
 F(x,y) -> G(y) | g(x) ->* z
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> x | g(x) ->* z, g(y) ->* z
 g(x) -> c | d ->* c
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

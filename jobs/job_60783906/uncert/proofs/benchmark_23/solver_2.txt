(10) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x, x) -> A

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> e <= d -> l


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(d)
   U1(l) -> e
   h(x, x) -> A

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A) = 0
   POL(U1(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(d) = 1
   POL(e) = 2
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(h(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(l) = 1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   h(x, x) -> A




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(d)
   U1(l) -> e

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(d) = 1
   POL(e) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(l) = 2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(l) -> e




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(d)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:d > f_1 > U1_1

and weight map:

   d=2
   f_1=2
   U1_1=1

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x) -> U1(d)




----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(9) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

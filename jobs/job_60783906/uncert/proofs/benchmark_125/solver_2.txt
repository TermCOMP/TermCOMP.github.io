Quasi decreasingness of the given CTRS could be proven:

(0) CTRS
(1) CTRSToQTRSProof [SOUND, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 23 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(c) -> d

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x, y) -> z <= x -> z
   g(x) -> b <= h(x) -> d


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(x)
   U1(z) -> z
   g(x) -> U2(h(x))
   U2(d) -> b
   h(c) -> d

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:c > g_1 > U2_1 > b > h_1 > d > f_2 > U1_1

and weight map:

   d=2
   b=3
   c=1
   U1_1=1
   g_1=2
   U2_1=1
   h_1=1
   f_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, y) -> U1(x)
   U1(z) -> z
   g(x) -> U2(h(x))
   U2(d) -> b
   h(c) -> d




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

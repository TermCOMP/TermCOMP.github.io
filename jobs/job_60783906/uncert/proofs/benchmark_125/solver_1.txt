Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y z)
(RULES
f(x,y) -> z | x ->* z
g(x) -> b | h(x) ->* d
h(c) -> d
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> z | x ->* z
 g(x) -> b | h(x) ->* d
 h(c) -> d
-> The system is a deterministic 3-CTRS.

2D Dependency Pair Processor:

Conditional Termination Problem 1:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:

The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> z | x ->* z
 g(x) -> b | h(x) ->* d
 h(c) -> d
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 G(x) -> H(x)
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> z | x ->* z
 g(x) -> b | h(x) ->* d
 h(c) -> d
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

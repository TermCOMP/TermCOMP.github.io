Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   b -> d
   c -> e
   d -> e
   k -> e
   l -> e
   s(c) -> t(k)
   s(c) -> t(l)
   s(e) -> t(e)
   g(x, x) -> h(x, x)

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> pair(x, y) <= s(x) -> t(y)


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(s(x), x)
   U1(t(y), x) -> pair(x, y)
   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   b -> d

   d -> e
   k -> e
   l -> e
   s(c) -> t(k)
   s(c) -> t(l)
   s(e) -> t(e)
   g(x, x) -> h(x, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(a) = 2
   POL(b) = 1
   POL(c) = 0
   POL(d) = 1
   POL(e) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(g(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(h(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(k) = 0
   POL(l) = 0
   POL(pair(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(t(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a -> c
   a -> d
   b -> c
   d -> e

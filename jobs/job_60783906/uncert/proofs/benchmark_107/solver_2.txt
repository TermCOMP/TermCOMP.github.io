Quasi decreasingness of the given CTRS could be proven:

(0) CTRS
(1) CTRSToQTRSProof [SOUND, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 19 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> b

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   c -> d <= a -> x, b -> x


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c -> U1(a)
   U1(x) -> U2(b)
   U2(x) -> d
   a -> b

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:c > U1_1 > U2_1 > d > a > b

and weight map:

   c=4
   a=2
   b=2
   d=2
   U1_1=2
   U2_1=1

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   c -> U1(a)
   U1(x) -> U2(b)
   U2(x) -> d
   a -> b




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

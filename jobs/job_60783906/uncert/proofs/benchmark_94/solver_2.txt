----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x) -> a
   g(x) -> x
   c -> c

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   g(x) -> a <= h(x) -> b


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(x) -> U1(h(x))
   U1(b) -> a
   h(x) -> a
   g(x) -> x
   c -> c

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:c > h_1 > g_1 > U1_1 > a > b

and weight map:

   b=1
   a=2
   c=1
   g_1=2
   U1_1=1
   h_1=1

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   g(x) -> U1(h(x))
   U1(b) -> a
   h(x) -> a
   g(x) -> x




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c -> c

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   c -> c

The signature Sigma is {c}
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c -> c

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   c


----------------------------------------

(7) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C -> C

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c -> c

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   c

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C -> C

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   c

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   c


----------------------------------------

(12)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C -> C

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = C evaluates to  t =C

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from C to C.

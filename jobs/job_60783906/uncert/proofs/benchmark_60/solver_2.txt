(7) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(8) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> c
   a -> d

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x, y) -> z <= c -> x, y -> z


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(c, y)
   U1(x, y) -> U2(y)
   U2(z) -> z
   a -> c
   a -> d

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(U2(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a) = 1
   POL(c) = 1
   POL(d) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + 2*x_2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a -> d




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(c, y)
   U1(x, y) -> U2(y)
   U2(z) -> z
   a -> c

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:a > f_2 > U1_2 > U2_1 > c

and weight map:

   c=1
   a=1
   U2_1=1
   f_2=0
   U1_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, y) -> U1(c, y)
   U1(x, y) -> U2(y)
   U2(z) -> z
   a -> c




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

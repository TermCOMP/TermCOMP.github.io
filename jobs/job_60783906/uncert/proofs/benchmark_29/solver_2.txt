Quasi decreasingness of the given CTRS could be proven:

(0) CTRS
(1) CTRSToQTRSProof [SOUND, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 17 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   isnoc(cons(y, nil)) -> tp2(nil, y)

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   isnoc(cons(x, ys)) -> tp2(cons(x, xs), y) <= isnoc(ys) -> tp2(xs, y)


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   isnoc(cons(x, ys)) -> U1(isnoc(ys), x)
   U1(tp2(xs, y), x) -> tp2(cons(x, xs), y)
   isnoc(cons(y, nil)) -> tp2(nil, y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:nil > isnoc_1 > U1_2 > tp2_2 > cons_2

and weight map:

   nil=1
   isnoc_1=2
   cons_2=0
   U1_2=0
   tp2_2=2

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   isnoc(cons(x, ys)) -> U1(isnoc(ys), x)
   U1(tp2(xs, y), x) -> tp2(cons(x, xs), y)
   isnoc(cons(y, nil)) -> tp2(nil, y)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

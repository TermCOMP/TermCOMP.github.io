(8) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   sub(z, 0) -> z

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   sub(s(z), s(y)) -> x <= sub(z, y) -> x


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   sub(s(z), s(y)) -> U1(sub(z, y))
   U1(x) -> x
   sub(z, 0) -> z

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 2
   POL(U1(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(sub(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + x_2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   sub(s(z), s(y)) -> U1(sub(z, y))
   sub(z, 0) -> z




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U1(x) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(x) -> x




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 a -> t(c)
 a -> t(d)
 f(x,y) -> z | x ->* t(z)
 g(x,x) -> h(x,x)
-> The system is a deterministic 3-CTRS.

The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> t(c)
 a -> t(d)
 f(x,y) -> z | x ->* t(z)
 g(x,x) -> h(x,x)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a -> t(c)
 a -> t(d)
 f(x,y) -> z | x ->* t(z)
 g(x,x) -> h(x,x)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

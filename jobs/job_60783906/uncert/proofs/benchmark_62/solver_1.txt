(RULES
A -> B
f(x) -> x | x ->* a
g(x) -> C | A ->* B
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 A -> B
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> C | A ->* B
-> The system is a 2-CTRS.

2D Dependency Pair Processor:

Conditional Termination Problem 1:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 A -> B
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a

 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> C | A ->* B


The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 A -> B
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> C | A ->* B
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:

-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 A -> B
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> C | A ->* B
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

with rule U1^1(d) -> U2^1(d) at position [] and matcher [ ]

U2^1(d) -> A
with rule U2^1(d) -> A at position [] and matcher [ ]

A -> U1^1(d)
with rule A -> U1^1(d)

Now applying the matcher to the start term leads to a term which is equal to the last term in the rewriting sequence


All these steps are and every following step will be a correct step w.r.t to Q.

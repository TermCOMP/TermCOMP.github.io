R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   App(App(App(S, x0), x1), x2)
   App(App(K, x0), x1)
   App(I, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(33) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By instantiating [LPAR04] the rule U3^1(I, a, b, c) -> APP(b, c) we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (U3^1(I, I, I, I) -> APP(I, I),U3^1(I, I, I, I) -> APP(I, I))

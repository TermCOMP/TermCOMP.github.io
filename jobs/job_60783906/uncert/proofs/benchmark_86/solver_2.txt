----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(y, y) -> a

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x, x) -> b <= f(x, x) -> a, x -> a


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, x) -> U1(f(x, x), x)
   U1(a, x) -> U2(x)
   U2(a) -> b
   f(y, y) -> a

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x, x) -> U1^1(f(x, x), x)
   F(x, x) -> F(x, x)
   U1^1(a, x) -> U2^1(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, x) -> U1(f(x, x), x)
   U1(a, x) -> U2(x)
   U2(a) -> b
   f(y, y) -> a

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x, x) -> F(x, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, x) -> U1(f(x, x), x)
   U1(a, x) -> U2(x)
   U2(a) -> b
   f(y, y) -> a

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x, x) -> F(x, x)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = F(x, x) evaluates to  t =F(x, x)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from F(x, x) to F(x, x).

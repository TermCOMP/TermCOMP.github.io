(4) QTRS
(5) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]

(10) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(x) -> h(x, x)
   h(x, y) -> i(x)

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> x <= x -> a


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(x, x)
   U1(a, x) -> x
   g(x) -> h(x, x)
   h(x, y) -> i(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(a) = 2
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(h(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(i(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(a, x) -> x
   h(x, y) -> i(x)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(x, x)
   g(x) -> h(x, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(h(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   g(x) -> h(x, x)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(x, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Quasi precedence:
f_1 > U1_2


Status:
f_1: multiset status
U1_2: multiset status

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x) -> U1(x, x)




----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(9) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

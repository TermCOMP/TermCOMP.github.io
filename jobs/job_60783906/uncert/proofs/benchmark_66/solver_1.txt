Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y)
(RULES
f(x) -> x | x ->* a
g(x) -> h(x,x)
h(x,y) -> i(x)
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> h(x,x)
 h(x,y) -> i(x)
-> The system is a 2-CTRS.

Problem 1: 

2D Dependency Pair Processor:

Conditional Termination Problem 1:
-> Pairs:

-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> h(x,x)
 h(x,y) -> i(x)

Conditional Termination Problem 2:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> h(x,x)
 h(x,y) -> i(x)


The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 G(x) -> H(x,x)
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> h(x,x)
 h(x,y) -> i(x)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> QPairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(x) -> x | x ->* a
 g(x) -> h(x,x)
 h(x,y) -> i(x)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

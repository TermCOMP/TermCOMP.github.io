----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> b
   c -> f(a)
   f(a) -> c
   c -> g(b)

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x) -> g(x) <= f(x) -> g(b)


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(b), x) -> g(x)
   a -> b
   c -> f(a)
   f(a) -> c
   c -> g(b)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x) -> U1^1(f(x), x)
   F(x) -> F(x)
   C -> F(a)
   C -> A
   F(a) -> C

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(b), x) -> g(x)
   a -> b
   c -> f(a)
   f(a) -> c
   c -> g(b)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a) -> C
   C -> F(a)
   F(x) -> F(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> U1(f(x), x)
   U1(g(b), x) -> g(x)
   a -> b
   c -> f(a)
   f(a) -> c
   c -> g(b)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a) -> C
   C -> F(a)
   F(x) -> F(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a -> b

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.


Strictly oriented rules of the TRS R:

   a -> b

Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(C) = 2
   POL(F(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a) = 2
   POL(b) = 0


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a) -> C
   C -> F(a)
   F(x) -> F(x)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = F(x) evaluates to  t =F(x)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from F(x) to F(x).

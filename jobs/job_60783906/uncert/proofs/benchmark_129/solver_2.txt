(8) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   plus(x, 0) -> x
   plus(0, x) -> x

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   plus(s(x), y) -> s(z) <= plus(x, y) -> z


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   plus(s(x), y) -> U1(plus(x, y))
   U1(z) -> s(z)
   plus(x, 0) -> x
   plus(0, x) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 1
   POL(U1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   plus(x, 0) -> x
   plus(0, x) -> x




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   plus(s(x), y) -> U1(plus(x, y))
   U1(z) -> s(z)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:plus_2 > U1_1 > s_1

and weight map:

   s_1=1
   U1_1=1
   plus_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   plus(s(x), y) -> U1(plus(x, y))
   U1(z) -> s(z)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

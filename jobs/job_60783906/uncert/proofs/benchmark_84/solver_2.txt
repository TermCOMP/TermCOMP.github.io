----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Conditional term rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(s(x)) -> x
   h(s(x)) -> x
   a -> d
   b -> d

The conditional TRS C consists of the following conditional rules:

   f(x, y) -> g(x) <= a -> d
   f(x, y) -> h(x) <= b -> d


----------------------------------------

(1) CTRSToQTRSProof (SOUND)
The conditional rules have been transormed into unconditional rules according to [CTRS,AAECCNOC].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(a, x)
   U1(d, x) -> g(x)
   f(x, y) -> U2(b, x)
   U2(d, x) -> h(x)
   g(s(x)) -> x
   h(s(x)) -> x
   a -> d
   b -> d

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(U2(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(a) = 2
   POL(b) = 1
   POL(d) = 1
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(g(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(h(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   g(s(x)) -> x
   h(s(x)) -> x
   a -> d




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(a, x)
   U1(d, x) -> g(x)
   f(x, y) -> U2(b, x)
   U2(d, x) -> h(x)
   b -> d

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(U2(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(a) = 0
   POL(b) = 2
   POL(d) = 1
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(g(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(h(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(d, x) -> g(x)
   b -> d




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> U1(a, x)
   f(x, y) -> U2(b, x)
   U2(d, x) -> h(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:f_2 > U2_2 > h_1 > d > b > a > U1_2

and weight map:

   a=2
   b=2
   d=1
   h_1=1
   f_2=1
   U1_2=0
   U2_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, y) -> U1(a, x)
   f(x, y) -> U2(b, x)
   U2(d, x) -> h(x)




----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(9) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

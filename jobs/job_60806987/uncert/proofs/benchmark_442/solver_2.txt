(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(p(b(x1))) -> b(q(b(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   q(x1) -> 1(q(1(x1)))
   1(p(0(1(0(x1))))) -> p(x1)
   q(x1) -> 1(p(1(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 0(q(0(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 0(p(0(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   b(p(b(x1))) -> B(q(b(x1)))
   b(p(b(x1))) -> b(Q(b(x1)))
   b(p(b(x1))) -> b(q(B(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   q(x1) -> 1^1(Q(1(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 1^1(q(1^1(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 1(Q(1^1(x1)))
   1(p(0(1(0(x1))))) -> p(x1)
   q(x1) -> 1^1(p(1^1(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 0(Q(0(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 0(p(0(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  1 SCC with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 1 subproblem.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   b(p(b(x1))) -> B(q(b(x1)))
   b(p(b(x1))) -> b(q(B(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   q(x1) -> 1(q(1(x1)))
   1(p(0(1(0(x1))))) -> p(x1)
   q(x1) -> 1(p(1(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 0(q(0(x1)))
   b(p(b(x1))) -> b(q(b(x1)))
   q(x1) -> 0(p(0(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:b_1 = 
p_1 = 
q_1 = 
0_1 = 
B_1 = 
1_1 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
B(x1)  =  B(x1)

p(x1)  =  x1

b(x1)  =  b(x1)

q(x1)  =  x1

1(x1)  =  x1

0(x1)  =  x1


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: B_1 > b_1

Status: B_1: [1]
b_1: multiset status

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   q0(x1) -> 10(q0(10(x1)))
   10(p0(00(10(00(x1))))) -> p0(x1)
   q0(x1) -> 10(p0(10(x1)))
   q0(x1) -> 00(q0(00(x1)))
   b0(p0(b0(x1))) -> b0(q0(b0(x1)))
   q0(x1) -> 00(p0(00(x1)))

We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   B0(p0(b0(x1))) -> B0(x1)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(00(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(10(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(B0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b0(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1

----------------------------------------

(9) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By narrowing [LPAR04] the rule B0(p0(b0(x1))) -> B0(q0(b0(x1))) at position [0] we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (B0(p0(b0(y0))) -> B0(10(q0(10(b0(y0))))),B0(p0(b0(y0))) -> B0(10(q0(10(b0(y0))))))

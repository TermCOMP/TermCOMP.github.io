Proof Outline:

Remains to prove termination of a 6-rules system (4 strict rules).
Loop of length 8 starting with a source of size 8.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, c ↦ 1, b ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 6-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 0 ,
  0 2 2 ⟶ 2 2 0 ,
  0 0 1 ⟶ 2 2 0 ,
  2 1 0 ⟶ 0 1 1 ,
  0 1 0 →= 0 1 2 ,
  2 0 0 →= 0 0 0 }

Loop of length 8 starting with a source of size 8.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 2 2 0 1 0 1 0
    Applying rule 0 2 2 ⟶ 2 2 0 at position 0 results in
2 2 0 0 1 0 1 0
    Applying rule 2 0 0 →= 0 0 0 at position 1 results in
2 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
    Applying rule 2 0 0 →= 0 0 0 at position 0 results in
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
    Applying rule 0 1 0 →= 0 1 2 at position 3 results in
0 0 0 0 1 2 1 0
    Applying rule 2 1 0 ⟶ 0 1 1 at position 5 results in
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 0 at position 5 results in
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 0 at position 3 results in
0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 2 2 0 at position 1 results in
0 2 2 0 1 0 1 0

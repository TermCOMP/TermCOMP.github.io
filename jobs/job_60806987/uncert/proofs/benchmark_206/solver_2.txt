Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(a(x1))) -> b(a(c(x1)))
   a(c(c(x1))) -> a(b(b(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> a(a(a(x1)))
   b(c(c(x1))) -> a(c(a(x1)))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> b(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(a(x1))) -> c(a(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> b(b(a(x1)))
   a(a(c(x1))) -> a(a(a(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> a(c(a(x1)))
   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(c(a(x1))) -> c(a(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> b(b(a(x1)))
   a(a(c(x1))) -> a(a(a(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> a(c(a(x1)))
   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(c(b(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

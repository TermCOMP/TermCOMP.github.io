Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   c(a(x)) -> c(b(b(b(x))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(a(x)) -> b(a(a(b(x))))
   c(b(x)) -> a(a(a(c(x))))

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [x' / b(x')] occurs in the last term at position [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].

Context: a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a([])))))))))))))))))))))))))))

Therefore, the relative TRS problem does not terminate.

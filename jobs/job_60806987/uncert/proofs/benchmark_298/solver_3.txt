Remains to prove termination of a 3-rules system (1 strict rule).
Incorporating context-free projections into matching.
Remains to prove termination of a 2-rules system (1 strict rule).
Loop of length 13 starting with a source of size 0.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 1 1 ⟶ ,
  0 →= ,
  →= 0 0 1 0 0 }

Incorporating context-free projections into matching.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 1 1 ⟶ ,
  →= 0 0 1 0 0 }

Loop of length 13 starting with a source of size 0.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:


    Applying rule →= 0 0 1 0 0 at position 0 results in
0 0 1 0 0
    Applying rule →= 0 0 1 0 0 at position 1 results in
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
    Applying rule →= 0 0 1 0 0 at position 2 results in
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
    Applying rule 0 1 1 1 ⟶ at position 0 results in
0 0

Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(b(b(x1))) -> x1
   c(c(c(x1))) -> a(a(x1))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(x1) -> a(c(b(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]

   c(b(b(b(x1)))) -> c(x1)
   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(x1)

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))) -> b_{c_1}(x1)
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(x1)

   a_{a_1}(x1) -> a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))) -> b_{c_1}(x1)
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(x1)
   c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> c_{b_1}(x1)
   c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))) -> c_{c_1}(x1)
   c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(x1)
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))) -> a_{c_1}(x1)
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))
   b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))
   b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))
Rules from S:
none

(6)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
R is empty.
The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a_{b_1}(x1) -> a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))
   a_{c_1}(x1) -> a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
   a_{a_1}(x1) -> a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(7) RIsEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

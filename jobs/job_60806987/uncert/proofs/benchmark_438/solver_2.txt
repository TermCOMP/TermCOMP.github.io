Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(x1) -> b(c(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   a(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   d(c(x1)) -> d(a(x1))
   d(a(x1)) -> d(c(b(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[1], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0], [2]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(d(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[2, 2], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   a(x1) -> b(c(x1))
Rules from S:
none

----------------------------------------

(5) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]

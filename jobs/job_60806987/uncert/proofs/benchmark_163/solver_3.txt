Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 0 1 1 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 ,
  1 1 0 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 ,
  0 0 →= 0 0 0 0 0 0 ,
  1 1 →= 1 1 1 1 1 1 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 7:

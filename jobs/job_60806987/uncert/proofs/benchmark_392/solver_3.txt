Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 2 1 1 1 ,
  2 0 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 ,
  1 2 →= 0 2 0 0 }

Strictifying the system, i. e., replacing each non-strict rule l →= r by l → r.

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 2 1 1 1 ,
  2 0 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 ,
  1 2 ⟶ 0 2 0 0 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 0 2 ,
  1 2 ⟶ 1 0 0 0 ,
  2 0 ⟶ 1 1 2 1 }

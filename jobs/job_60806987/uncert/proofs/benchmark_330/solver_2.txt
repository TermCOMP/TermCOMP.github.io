(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(b(a(x))) -> x

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(b(x)) -> b(b(a(a(b(x)))))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We have reversed the following relative TRS [REVERSE]:
The set of rules R is 
   a(b(a(x))) -> x

The set of rules S is 
   a(b(x)) -> b(b(a(a(b(x)))))

We have obtained the following relative TRS:
The set of rules R is 
   a(b(a(x))) -> x

The set of rules S is 
   b(a(x)) -> b(a(a(b(b(x)))))


----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(b(a(x))) -> x

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(a(x)) -> b(a(a(b(b(x)))))


----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(a(b(a(x)))) -> a(x)
   b(a(b(a(x)))) -> b(x)

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(a(x)) -> b(a(a(b(b(x)))))


----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x)))) -> a_{a_1}(x)
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x)))) -> a_{b_1}(x)
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x)))) -> b_{a_1}(x)
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x)))) -> b_{b_1}(x)

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x)))))


----------------------------------------

(7) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 1], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0], [2]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x)))) -> a_{a_1}(x)
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x)))) -> a_{b_1}(x)
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x)))) -> b_{a_1}(x)
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x)))) -> b_{b_1}(x)
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
R is empty.
The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x)))))


----------------------------------------

(9) RIsEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(10)

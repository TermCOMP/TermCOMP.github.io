(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(q(b(x1))) -> b(p(b(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   0(p(0(x1))) -> q(x1)
   1(q(1(x1))) -> q(x1)
   p(x1) -> 1(p(1(0(1(x1)))))
   0(q(0(x1))) -> q(x1)
   1(p(1(x1))) -> q(x1)


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   b(q(b(x1))) -> B(p(b(x1)))
   b(q(b(x1))) -> b(P(b(x1)))
   b(q(b(x1))) -> b(p(B(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   0(p(0(x1))) -> q(x1)
   1(q(1(x1))) -> q(x1)
   p(x1) -> 1^1(P(1(0(1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1^1(p(1^1(0(1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1^1(p(1(0^1(1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1^1(p(1(0(1^1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1(P(1^1(0(1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1(P(1(0^1(1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1(P(1(0(1^1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1(p(1^1(0^1(1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1(p(1^1(0(1^1(x1)))))
   p(x1) -> 1(p(1(0^1(1^1(x1)))))
   0(q(0(x1))) -> q(x1)
   1(p(1(x1))) -> q(x1)


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  1 SCC with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 1 subproblem.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   b(q(b(x1))) -> b(p(B(x1)))
   b(q(b(x1))) -> B(p(b(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   0(p(0(x1))) -> q(x1)
   1(q(1(x1))) -> q(x1)
   p(x1) -> 1(p(1(0(1(x1)))))
   b(q(b(x1))) -> b(p(b(x1)))
   0(q(0(x1))) -> q(x1)
   1(p(1(x1))) -> q(x1)


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:b_1 = 
p_1 = 
q_1 = 
0_1 = 
B_1 = 
1_1 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
B(x1)  =  B(x1)

q(x1)  =  q(x1)

b(x1)  =  x1

p(x1)  =  p(x1)

1(x1)  =  x1

0(x1)  =  x1


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: [q_1, p_1] > B_1

Status: B_1: multiset status
q_1: multiset status
p_1: multiset status


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B0(q0(b0(x1))) -> B0(p0(b0(x1)))
   B0(q0(b0(x1))) -> B0(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   00(p0(00(x1))) -> q0(x1)
   10(q0(10(x1))) -> q0(x1)
   p0(x1) -> 10(p0(10(00(10(x1)))))
   b0(q0(b0(x1))) -> b0(p0(b0(x1)))
   00(q0(00(x1))) -> q0(x1)
   10(p0(10(x1))) -> q0(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   B0(q0(b0(x1))) -> B0(x1)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(00(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(10(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(B0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b0(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1

   p0(x1) -> 10(p0(10(00(10(x1)))))
   b0(q0(b0(x1))) -> b0(p0(b0(x1)))
   00(q0(00(x1))) -> q0(x1)
   10(p0(10(x1))) -> q0(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By narrowing [LPAR04] the rule B0(q0(b0(x1))) -> B0(p0(b0(x1))) at position [0] we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (B0(q0(b0(y0))) -> B0(10(p0(10(00(10(b0(y0))))))),B0(q0(b0(y0))) -> B0(10(p0(10(00(10(b0(y0))))))))
   (B0(q0(b0(q0(b0(x0))))) -> B0(p0(b0(p0(b0(x0))))),B0(q0(b0(q0(b0(x0))))) -> B0(p0(b0(p0(b0(x0))))))

   10(q0(10(x1))) -> q0(x1)
   p0(x1) -> 10(p0(10(00(10(x1)))))
   b0(q0(b0(x1))) -> b0(p0(b0(x1)))
   00(q0(00(x1))) -> q0(x1)
   10(p0(10(x1))) -> q0(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) SemLabProof (SOUND)
We found the following model for the rules of the TRSs R and P.
Interpretation over the domain with elements from 0 to 1.
B0: 0
00: 0
q0: 0
10: x<sub>0</sub>

   B0.0(q0.1(b0.0(y0))) -> B0.0(10.0(p0.0(10.0(00.1(10.1(b0.0(y0)))))))
   B0.0(q0.1(b0.1(y0))) -> B0.0(10.0(p0.0(10.0(00.1(10.1(b0.1(y0)))))))
   B0.0(q0.1(b0.0(q0.1(b0.0(x0))))) -> B0.0(p0.1(b0.0(p0.1(b0.0(x0)))))
   B0.0(q0.1(b0.0(q0.1(b0.1(x0))))) -> B0.0(p0.1(b0.0(p0.1(b0.1(x0)))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   00.0(p0.0(00.0(x1))) -> q0.0(x1)
   00.0(p0.0(00.1(x1))) -> q0.1(x1)
   10.0(q0.0(10.0(x1))) -> q0.0(x1)
   10.0(q0.1(10.1(x1))) -> q0.1(x1)
   p0.0(x1) -> 10.0(p0.0(10.0(00.0(10.0(x1)))))

We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B0.0(q0.1(b0.0(y0))) -> B0.0(10.0(p0.0(10.0(00.1(10.1(b0.0(y0)))))))
   B0.0(q0.1(b0.1(y0))) -> B0.0(10.0(p0.0(10.0(00.1(10.1(b0.1(y0)))))))
   B0.0(q0.1(b0.0(q0.1(b0.0(x0))))) -> B0.0(p0.1(b0.0(p0.1(b0.0(x0)))))
   B0.0(q0.1(b0.0(q0.1(b0.1(x0))))) -> B0.0(p0.1(b0.0(p0.1(b0.1(x0)))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(00.0(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(00.1(x_1)) = 0
   POL(10.0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(10.1(x_1)) = 1
   POL(B0.0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b0.0(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b0.1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(p0.0(x_1)) = 0
   POL(p0.1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(q0.0(x_1)) = 0
   POL(q0.1(x_1)) = 1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   00.0(p0.0(00.1(x1))) -> q0.1(x1)
   10.0(q0.0(10.0(x1))) -> q0.0(x1)
   10.0(q0.1(10.1(x1))) -> q0.1(x1)
   p0.0(x1) -> 10.0(p0.0(10.0(00.0(10.0(x1)))))

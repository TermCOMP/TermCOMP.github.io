----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   c(b(x)) -> a(a(b(c(x))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(b(x)) -> a(b(a(a(x))))
   c(a(x)) -> c(b(b(b(x))))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(b(x)) -> A(a(b(c(x))))
   c(b(x)) -> a(A(b(c(x))))
   c(b(x)) -> a(a(b(C(x))))

and relative ADPs:

   a(b(x)) -> A(b(A(a(x))))
   a(b(x)) -> A(b(a(A(x))))
   a(b(x)) -> a(b(A(A(x))))
   c(a(x)) -> C(b(b(b(x))))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  1 SCC with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 1 subproblem.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(b(x)) -> a(a(b(C(x))))

and relative ADPs:

   c(a(x)) -> C(b(b(b(x))))
   a(b(x)) -> a(b(a(a(x))))
   c(b(x)) -> a(a(b(c(x))))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPDerelatifying2Proof (SOUND)


We use the second derelatifying processor (moving relative rules)[IJCAR24].
We move one relative ADP with annotations to the non-relative part and create an own Problem for each movable rule.

Resulting in 1 subproblem.
If one of them is SN, then our original relative ADP problem is SN
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(b(x)) -> a(a(b(C(x))))
   c(a(x)) -> C(b(b(b(x))))

and relative ADPs:

   a(b(x)) -> a(b(a(a(x))))
   c(b(x)) -> a(a(b(c(x))))


----------------------------------------

(7) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:a_1 = 
b_1 = 
c_1 = 
C_1 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: C_1 > b_1
a_1 > b_1

Status: C_1: [1]
b_1: multiset status
a_1: multiset status


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C0(b0(x)) -> C0(x)
   C0(a0(x)) -> C0(b0(b0(b0(x))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a0(b0(x)) -> a0(b0(a0(a0(x))))
   c0(a0(x)) -> c0(b0(b0(b0(x))))
   c0(b0(x)) -> a0(a0(b0(c0(x))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPBoundsTAProof (EQUIVALENT)
The DP-Problem (P, R) could be shown to be Match-DP-Bounded [TAB_NONLEFTLINEAR] by 1 for the Rule: 
   C0(b0(x)) -> C0(x)
by considering the usable rules: 
none

The compatible tree automaton used to show the Match-DP-Boundedness is represented by: 
final states : [0]
transitions: 
#0() -> 1
C00(1) -> 0
#0() -> 5
b00(5) -> 4
b00(4) -> 3
b00(3) -> 2
C00(2) -> 0
C00(3) -> 0
C00(4) -> 0
C00(5) -> 0
C01(3) -> 0
C01(4) -> 0
C01(5) -> 0

----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C0(a0(x)) -> C0(b0(b0(b0(x))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a0(b0(x)) -> a0(b0(a0(a0(x))))
   c0(a0(x)) -> c0(b0(b0(b0(x))))
   c0(b0(x)) -> a0(a0(b0(c0(x))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(12)
TRUE

Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(a(x1))
   c(b(x1)) -> b(a(b(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(x1) -> a(c(a(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We have reversed the following relative TRS [REVERSE]:
The set of rules R is 
   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(a(x1))
   c(b(x1)) -> b(a(b(x1)))

The set of rules S is 
   a(x1) -> a(c(a(x1)))

We have obtained the following relative TRS:
The set of rules R is 
   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(b(x1))
   b(c(x1)) -> b(a(b(x1)))

The set of rules S is 
   a(x1) -> a(c(a(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(x1) -> a(c(a(x1)))

   a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   c(b(a(a(x1)))) -> c(a(b(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(x1) -> a(c(a(x1)))


----------------------------------------

We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled


----------------------------------------

Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))
   b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
   b_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

----------------------------------------

(7) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))

   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))

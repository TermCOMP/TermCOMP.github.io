Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(c(a(x1))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(a(x1))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(x1) -> c(b(x1))

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]

(5) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:

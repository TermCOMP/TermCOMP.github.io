Proof Outline:

Remains to prove termination of a 2-rules system (1 strict rule).
Applying context closure.
Remains to prove termination of a 8-rules system (4 strict rules).
Loop of length 4 starting with a source of size 6.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 1 0 ⟶ 1 ,
  →= 0 0 1 0 0 }

Applying context closure, possibly for a subsystem,
  with left contexts of length 1, right contexts of length 1.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 8-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 0 1 1 0 0 ⟶ 0 1 0 ,
  0 0 1 1 0 1 ⟶ 0 1 1 ,
  1 0 1 1 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 0 ,
  1 0 1 1 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 ,
  0 0 →= 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ,
  0 1 →= 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 ,
  1 0 →= 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 ,
  1 1 →= 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 }

Loop of length 4 starting with a source of size 6.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 1 1 0 1 0
    Applying rule 0 1 →= 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 at position 0 results in
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
    Applying rule 0 0 1 1 0 1 ⟶ 0 1 1 at position 4 results in
0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
    Applying rule 1 0 →= 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 at position 6 results in
0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
    Applying rule 1 0 1 1 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 0 at position 3 results in
0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

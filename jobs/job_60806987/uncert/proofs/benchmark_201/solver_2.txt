Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(b(x1)))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(b(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(c(b(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> b(a(b(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> C(c(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(C(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(B(x1)))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(B(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> C(a(C(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(C(B(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> B(a(B(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPReductionPairProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the reduction pair processor [IJCAR24].
The following rules can be oriented strictly (l^# > ann(r)) 
and therefore we can remove all of its annotations in the right-hand side:
Absolute ADPs:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(C(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(B(x1)))

Relative ADPs:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> C(a(C(x1)))


The remaining rules can at least be oriented weakly:
Absolute ADPs:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> C(c(b(x1)))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(B(x1)))

Relative ADPs:

   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(C(B(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> B(a(B(x1)))


Ordered with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B(x_1)) = 0
   POL(C(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b(x_1)) = 0
   POL(c(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> C(c(b(x1)))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(B(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(C(B(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(b(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> B(a(B(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPReductionPairProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the reduction pair processor [IJCAR24].
The following rules can be oriented strictly (l^# > ann(r)) 
and therefore we can remove all of its annotations in the right-hand side:
Absolute ADPs:

   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(B(x1)))

Relative ADPs:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(C(B(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(b(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> B(a(B(x1)))


The remaining rules can at least be oriented weakly:
Absolute ADPs:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> C(c(b(x1)))

Relative ADPs:
none


Ordered with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 3*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 3 + 2*x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 3 + 2*x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 3 + 2*x_1

Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> C(c(b(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(c(b(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> b(a(b(x1)))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(b(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(7) RelADPDerelatifyingProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C(c(a(x1))) -> C(c(b(x1)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(c(b(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> b(a(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(b(x1)))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(b(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) RFCMatchBoundsDPProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS P cup R can be shown by a matchbound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 5. This implies finiteness of the given DP problem.
The following rules (P cup R) were used to construct the certificate:

   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(c(b(x1)))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> b(a(b(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(b(x1)))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   C(c(a(x1))) -> C(c(b(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172

Node 107 is start node and node 108 is final node.

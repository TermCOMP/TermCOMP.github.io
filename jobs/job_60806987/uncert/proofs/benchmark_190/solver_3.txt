Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 0 ⟶ 0 1 1 1 0 ,
  1 1 1 →= 0 0 0 0 }

Strictifying the system, i. e., replacing each non-strict rule l →= r by l → r.

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 0 ⟶ 0 1 1 1 0 ,
  1 1 1 ⟶ 0 0 0 0 }

Removing 2 relatively RFC-match-bounded rules [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, WST 2022]
  (bounded by 1 for B = 5). The certifying automaton has 5 epsilon transitions:
  { (0,0,1) ⟶ (1,1,0), (0,1,3) ⟶ (0,0,0), (1,1,4) ⟶ (0,0,0), (1,1,4) ⟶ (0,0,4), (0,0,4) ⟶ (0,0,0) }
After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)
{ }

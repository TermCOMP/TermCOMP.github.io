Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(c(a(x1))) -> d(d(x1))
   b(x1) -> c(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(a(x1))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> d(x1)
   d(x1) -> a(b(x1))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We have reversed the following relative TRS [REVERSE]:
The set of rules R is 
   b(c(a(x1))) -> d(d(x1))
   b(x1) -> c(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(a(x1))))

The set of rules S is 
   a(b(x1)) -> d(x1)
   d(x1) -> a(b(x1))

We have obtained the following relative TRS:
The set of rules R is 
   a(c(b(x1))) -> d(d(x1))
   b(x1) -> c(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(c(a(x1))))

The set of rules S is 
   b(a(x1)) -> d(x1)
   d(x1) -> b(a(x1))


----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(c(b(x1))) -> d(d(x1))
   b(x1) -> c(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(c(a(x1))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> d(x1)
   d(x1) -> b(a(x1))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^3, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0, 2], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0], [2], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(d(x_1)) =  	[[0], [2], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   a(c(b(x1))) -> d(d(x1))
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(x1) -> c(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(c(a(x1))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> d(x1)
   d(x1) -> b(a(x1))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0], [2]] 	 +  	[[1, 1], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(d(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 1], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(c(a(x1))))
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(x1) -> c(c(x1))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> d(x1)
   d(x1) -> b(a(x1))


----------------------------------------

(7) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[1], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(d(x_1)) =  	[[1], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   b(x1) -> c(c(x1))
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
R is empty.
The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> d(x1)
   d(x1) -> b(a(x1))


----------------------------------------

(9) RIsEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

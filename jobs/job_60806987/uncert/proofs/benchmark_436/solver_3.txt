Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, c ↦ 1, a ↦ 2, d ↦ 3 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 5-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 2 ⟶ 3 3 ,
  0 ⟶ 1 1 ,
  2 2 ⟶ 2 1 0 2 ,
  2 0 →= 3 ,
  3 →= 2 0 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 4:

    ⎜ 0 0 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎝         ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛         ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 0 ⎟

    ⎜ 0 1 0 0 ⎟

    ⎜ 0 0 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎝         ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2, 3 ↦ 3 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ 1 1 ,

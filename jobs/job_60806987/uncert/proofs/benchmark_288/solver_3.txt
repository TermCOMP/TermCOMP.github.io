Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { c ↦ 0, a ↦ 1, b ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 6-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 1 2 ⟶ 0 1 0 ,
  1 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 1 ,
  1 2 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 ,
  1 2 2 ⟶ 1 0 2 ,
  1 2 2 →= 1 1 0 ,
  2 0 0 →= 2 1 2 }

Strictifying the system, i. e., replacing each non-strict rule l →= r by l → r.

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 6-rules system (6 strict rules)
{ 0 1 2 ⟶ 0 1 0 ,
  1 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 1 ,
  1 2 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 ,
  1 2 2 ⟶ 1 0 2 ,
  1 2 2 ⟶ 1 1 0 ,
  2 0 0 ⟶ 2 1 2 }

Inverting the length-preserving system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 6-rules system (6 strict rules)
{ 0 1 0 ⟶ 0 1 2 ,
  0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 ,
  0 1 0 ⟶ 1 2 1 ,
  1 0 2 ⟶ 1 2 2 ,
  1 1 0 ⟶ 1 2 2 ,
  2 1 2 ⟶ 2 0 0 }

Applying sparse untiling TRFCU(2) [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, FSCD 2019].
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 ,
  2 1 2 ⟶ 2 0 0 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)

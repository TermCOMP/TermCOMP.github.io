Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(b(a(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> b(a(c(x1)))
   c(a(c(x1))) -> b(b(c(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(c(c(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(c(b(x1))) -> a(b(a(x1)))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(c(c(x1)))
   c(a(b(x1))) -> a(b(c(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(B(a(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> B(a(c(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> b(a(C(x1)))
   c(a(c(x1))) -> B(b(c(x1)))
   c(a(c(x1))) -> b(B(c(x1)))
   c(a(c(x1))) -> b(b(C(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(C(c(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(c(C(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   b(c(b(x1))) -> a(B(a(x1)))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(C(C(x1)))
   c(a(b(x1))) -> a(B(C(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPReductionPairProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the reduction pair processor [IJCAR24].
The following rules can be oriented strictly (l^# > ann(r)) 
and therefore we can remove all of its annotations in the right-hand side:
Absolute ADPs:

   c(a(c(x1))) -> b(B(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(B(a(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> b(a(C(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(C(c(x1)))
   c(a(c(x1))) -> b(b(C(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(c(C(x1)))

Relative ADPs:

   b(c(b(x1))) -> a(B(a(x1)))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(C(C(x1)))
   c(a(b(x1))) -> a(B(C(x1)))


The remaining rules can at least be oriented weakly:
Absolute ADPs:

   c(a(c(x1))) -> B(b(c(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> B(a(c(x1)))

Relative ADPs:
none


Ordered with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B(x_1)) = 3 + 2*x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 3 + 2*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1

Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(a(c(x1))) -> B(b(c(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> B(a(c(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   b(c(b(x1))) -> a(b(a(x1)))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(c(c(x1)))
   c(c(a(x1))) -> b(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(b(a(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(c(c(x1)))
   c(a(b(x1))) -> a(b(c(x1)))
   c(a(c(x1))) -> b(b(c(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  0 SCCs with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 0 subproblems.

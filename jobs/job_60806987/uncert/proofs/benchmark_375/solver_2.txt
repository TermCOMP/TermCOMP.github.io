----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(x) -> x
   c(b(x)) -> a(c(x))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(x) -> a(b(x))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   a(x) -> x
   c(b(x)) -> A(c(x))
   c(b(x)) -> a(C(x))

and relative ADPs:

   a(x) -> A(b(x))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  1 SCC with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 1 subproblem.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   c(b(x)) -> a(C(x))

and relative ADPs:

   a(x) -> x
   a(x) -> a(b(x))
   c(b(x)) -> a(c(x))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:a_1 = 
b_1 = 
c_1 = 
C_1 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
C(x1)  =  x1

b(x1)  =  b(x1)


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: trivial

Status: b_1: [1]


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C0(b0(x)) -> C0(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a0(x) -> x
   a0(x) -> a0(b0(x))
   c0(b0(x)) -> a0(c0(x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPBoundsTAProof (EQUIVALENT)
The DP-Problem (P, R) could be shown to be Match-DP-Bounded [TAB_NONLEFTLINEAR] by 0 for the Rule: 
   C0(b0(x)) -> C0(x)
by considering the usable rules: 
none

The compatible tree automaton used to show the Match-DP-Boundedness is represented by: 
final states : [0]
transitions: 
#0() -> 1
C00(1) -> 0

----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a0(x) -> x
   a0(x) -> a0(b0(x))
   c0(b0(x)) -> a0(c0(x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

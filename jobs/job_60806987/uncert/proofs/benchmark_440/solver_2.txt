Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   b(x1) -> x1
   a(c(x1)) -> b(b(c(a(x1))))
   d(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(d(a(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We have reversed the following relative TRS [REVERSE]:
The set of rules R is 
   a(x1) -> x1
   b(x1) -> x1
   a(c(x1)) -> b(b(c(a(x1))))
   d(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(d(a(x1)))

The set of rules S is 
   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))

We have obtained the following relative TRS:
The set of rules R is 
   a(x1) -> x1
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(b(x1))))
   b(b(b(d(x1)))) -> a(d(a(x1)))

The set of rules S is 
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))


----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(b(x1))))
   b(b(b(d(x1)))) -> a(d(a(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 2], [0, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 1], [0, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[2, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(d(x_1)) =  	[[0], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 2]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   b(b(b(d(x1)))) -> a(d(a(x1)))
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(b(x1))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   a(x1) -> x1
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(x1) -> x1
   c(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(b(x1))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))


----------------------------------------

(7) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 2]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[2, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[2], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   c(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(b(x1))))
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))


----------------------------------------

(9) RelTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used the following monotonic ordering for rule removal:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed [MATRO] because they are oriented strictly:
Rules from R:

   b(x1) -> x1
Rules from S:
none




----------------------------------------

(10)

Relative term rewrite system:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))


----------------------------------------

(11) RIsEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

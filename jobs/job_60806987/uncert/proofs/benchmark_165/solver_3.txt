Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 5-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 0 1 0 ⟶ 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 ,
  0 1 1 0 1 1 0 ⟶ 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 ,
  0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 0 ,
  0 0 0 →= 0 1 0 1 1 0 ,
  0 1 0 1 1 0 →= 0 0 0 }

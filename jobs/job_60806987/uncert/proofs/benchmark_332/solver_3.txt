Proof Outline:

Remains to prove termination of a 3-rules system (1 strict rule).
Loop of length 11 starting with a source of size 3.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 0 0 0 ⟶ ,
  →= 1 0 1 ,
  1 1 1 →= }

Loop of length 11 starting with a source of size 3.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

1 1 0
    Applying rule →= 1 0 1 at position 0 results in
1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule →= 1 0 1 at position 1 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule →= 1 0 1 at position 3 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule →= 1 0 1 at position 5 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule →= 1 0 1 at position 6 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule →= 1 0 1 at position 8 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule →= 1 0 1 at position 10 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule 1 1 1 →= at position 12 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule 1 1 1 →= at position 13 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
    Applying rule 1 1 1 →= at position 14 results in
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ at position 11 results in

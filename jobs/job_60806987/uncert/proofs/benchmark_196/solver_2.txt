(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   b(b(a(x1))) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(c(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(c(b(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(b(a(x1)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   c(c(b(x1))) -> a(c(b(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(a(a(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   b(b(a(x1))) -> A(a(b(x1)))
   b(b(a(x1))) -> a(A(b(x1)))
   b(b(a(x1))) -> a(a(B(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> C(c(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(C(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(c(A(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> B(c(b(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(C(b(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(c(B(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> A(b(a(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(B(a(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(b(A(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   c(c(b(x1))) -> A(C(b(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> A(c(B(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> a(C(B(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> B(A(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> B(a(A(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(A(A(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPRuleRemovalProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the rule removal processor [IJCAR24].
The following rules can be ordered strictly and therefore removed:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> B(c(b(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(b(A(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(c(B(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> A(b(a(x1)))
   b(b(a(x1))) -> a(a(B(x1)))
   b(b(a(x1))) -> A(a(b(x1)))
   b(a(c(x1))) -> a(B(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(C(b(x1)))
   b(b(a(x1))) -> a(A(b(x1)))

   a(a(a(x1))) -> B(a(A(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> B(A(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(A(A(x1)))

c:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> C(c(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(C(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(c(A(x1)))

   c(c(b(x1))) -> A(C(b(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> a(C(B(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> A(c(B(x1)))

Ordered with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 3*x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 3*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> C(c(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(C(a(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(c(A(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   c(c(b(x1))) -> A(C(b(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> a(C(B(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> A(c(B(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  1 SCC with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 1 subproblem.

----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(c(A(x1)))

and relative ADPs:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> c(c(a(x1)))
   c(c(b(x1))) -> a(c(b(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(7) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:a_1 = 
b_1 = 
c_1 = 
A_1 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
A(x1)  =  x1

a(x1)  =  a(x1)


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: trivial

Status: a_1: multiset status


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A0(a0(a0(x1))) -> A0(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a0(a0(a0(x1))) -> c0(c0(a0(x1)))
   c0(c0(b0(x1))) -> a0(c0(b0(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   A0(a0(a0(x1))) -> A0(x1)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A0(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a0(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(b0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c0(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a0(a0(a0(x1))) -> c0(c0(a0(x1)))
   c0(c0(b0(x1))) -> a0(c0(b0(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(12)
YES

We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

split_in_4: (b,b,f,f) (b,f,f,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*U2_GAAA(X, Xs, is_out_ag) -> SPLIT_IN_GAAA(Xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 1


*SPLIT_IN_GAAA(.(X, Xs)) -> U1_GAAA(X, Xs, >_in_ag(0))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 1 > 2


*U1_GAAA(X, Xs, >_out_ag) -> U2_GAAA(X, Xs, is_in_ag(-(1)))
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 >= 2

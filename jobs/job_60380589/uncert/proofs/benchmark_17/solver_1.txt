(13) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = P_IN_AA evaluates to  t =P_IN_AA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from P_IN_AA to P_IN_AA.

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   P_IN_AA -> P_IN_AA

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.

(25) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = P_IN_AA evaluates to  t =P_IN_AA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from P_IN_AA to P_IN_AA.

We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   t_in_ -> U1_(eq_in_aa(X, f(X)))
   eq_in_aa(X, X) -> eq_out_aa(X, X)
   U1_(eq_out_aa(X, f(X))) -> t_out_
   t_in_ -> U2_(t_in_)
   U2_(t_out_) -> t_out_

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
t_in_  =  t_in_

U1_(x1)  =  U1_(x1)

(23) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = T_IN_ evaluates to  t =T_IN_

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from T_IN_ to T_IN_.

(27) TriplesToPiDPProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [DT09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

Transforming TRIPLES into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   TA_IN_ -> U1_^1(tA_in_)
   TA_IN_ -> TA_IN_

R is empty.
Pi is empty.
We have to consider all (P,R,Pi)-chains


Infinitary Constructor Rewriting Termination of PiDP implies Termination of TRIPLES



----------------------------------------

(28)
Obligation:
Pi DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   TA_IN_ -> U1_^1(tA_in_)
   TA_IN_ -> TA_IN_

R is empty.
Pi is empty.
We have to consider all (P,R,Pi)-chains
----------------------------------------

(29) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LOPSTR] contains 1 SCC with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(30)
Obligation:
Pi DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   TA_IN_ -> TA_IN_

R is empty.
Pi is empty.
We have to consider all (P,R,Pi)-chains
----------------------------------------

(31) PiDPToQDPProof (EQUIVALENT)
Transforming (infinitary) constructor rewriting Pi-DP problem [LOPSTR] into ordinary QDP problem [LPAR04] by application of Pi.
----------------------------------------

(32)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   TA_IN_ -> TA_IN_

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(33) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = TA_IN_ evaluates to  t =TA_IN_

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from TA_IN_ to TA_IN_.

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f1_in -> U1(f1_in)
   U1(f1_out1) -> f1_out1

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(37) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U1(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(f1_in) = 0
   POL(f1_out1) = 1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U1(f1_out1) -> f1_out1

   f1_in -> U1(f1_in)

Q is empty.

(39) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f1_in -> U1(f1_in)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f1_in


----------------------------------------

(41) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(42)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F1_IN -> F1_IN

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f1_in -> U1(f1_in)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f1_in

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(43) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F1_IN -> F1_IN

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f1_in

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(45) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f1_in


----------------------------------------

(46)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F1_IN -> F1_IN

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(47) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = F1_IN evaluates to  t =F1_IN

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from F1_IN to F1_IN.

We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

isort_in_2: (b,f)

insert_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U2_GGA(X, Y, Ys, >_out_gg(X, Y)) -> INSERT_IN_GGA(X, Ys)

(14) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*U2_GGA(X, Y, Ys, >_out_gg(X, Y)) -> INSERT_IN_GGA(X, Ys)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 4 > 1, 3 >= 2


*INSERT_IN_GGA(X, .(Y, Ys)) -> U2_GGA(X, Y, Ys, >_in_gg(X, Y))
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2, 2 > 3

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f0/3]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f0_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f3/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f3/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f0/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,D) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,D) 


### Specialization of cost equations f3/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f3/3 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 9 

### Ranking functions of CR f3(A,B,D) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f3(A,B,D) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B,D):
* Chain [[5,6]]...: 2*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [D=2] 

* Chain [[5,6],7]: 2*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [D=2] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [D=2] 


#### Cost of chains of f3(A,B,D):
* Chain [9]: 1*s(2)+0
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [8]...: 2*s(3)+0
  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of f3(A,B,D): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [9] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 
* Chain [8]... with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 

### Maximum cost of f3(A,B,D): inf 
Asymptotic class: infinity

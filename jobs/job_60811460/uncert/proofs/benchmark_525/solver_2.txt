Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f0/6]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f0_loop_cont/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/6
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/7

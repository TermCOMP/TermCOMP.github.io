* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f(A,B,C,D) 
* RF of phase [5,6]: [A-B-C]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(A,B,C,D) 
* Partial RF of phase [5,6]:
  - RF of loop [5:1,6:1]:

#### Cost of chains of f(A,B,C,D):
* Chain [[5,6],7]: 2*it(5)+0
  Such that:aux(3) =< A-B-C
it(5) =< aux(3)

  with precondition: [D=2,A>=B+C+1] 

* Chain [7]: 0

#### Cost of chains of start(A,B,C,D):
* Chain [9]: 0
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [8]: 2*s(2)+0
  Such that:s(1) =< A-B-C
s(2) =< s(1)

  with precondition: [A>=B+C+1]

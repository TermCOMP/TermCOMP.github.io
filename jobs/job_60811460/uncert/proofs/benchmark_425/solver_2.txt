=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f3/2]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f3_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f300/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f3/2
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f300/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f3/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f3/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f3(A,B) 
* RF of phase [5]: [A-1]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f3(A,B) 
* Partial RF of phase [5]:

### Specialization of cost equations f300/2 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9,10,11,12] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f300/2 
* CEs [11] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [12] --> Loop 9

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f0/7]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f3/5]
3. non_recursive  : [f0_loop_cont/6]
4. non_recursive  : [f2/5]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/7
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f0_loop_cont/6
4. SCC is partially evaluated into f2/5

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f0/7 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [7]

* CEs [7] --> Loop 8 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C,F,G,H,I) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C,F,G,H,I) 


### Specialization of cost equations f0_loop_cont/6

### Ranking functions of CR f0_loop_cont(A,B,C,D,E,F) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0_loop_cont(A,B,C,D,E,F) 


### Specialization of cost equations f2/5 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [11,12,13] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f2/5 
* CEs [12,13] --> Loop 11 
* CEs [11] --> Loop 12

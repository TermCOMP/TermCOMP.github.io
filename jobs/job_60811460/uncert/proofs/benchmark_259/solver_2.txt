Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f2/2]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f2_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f0/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f2/2
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f2/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f2/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 6 

### Ranking functions of CR f2(A,B) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f2(A,B) 


### Specialization of cost equations f0/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [9,10] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 7 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 9 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 10 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f2(A,B):
* Chain [[5]]...: 1*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [A>=101,B=2] 

* Chain [[5],6]: 1*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [B=2,A>=101] 

* Chain [6]: 0
  with precondition: [B=2,A>=101] 


#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B):
* Chain [10]: 1*s(2)+0
  with precondition: [A+99>=0] 

* Chain [9]: 1*s(3)+0
  with precondition: [A>=1] 

* Chain [8]...: 1*s(4)+0
  with precondition: [A+99>=0] 

* Chain [7]...: 1*s(5)+0
  with precondition: [A>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of f0(A,B): 
-------------------------------------

WORST_CASE(?, O(1))


Initial Problem
  Start:  l0
  Program_Vars:  X₀, X₁, X₂
  Temp_Vars:  D, E, F
  Locations:  l0, l1
  Return Locations:  
  Transitions:
  t₀: l0(X₀, X₁, X₂) → l1(D, E, F)


Preprocessing
  Eliminate variables [D; E; F; X₀; X₁; X₂] that do not contribute to the problem


Problem after Preprocessing

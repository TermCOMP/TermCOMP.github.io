Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f1/3]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f1_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f0/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f1/3 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is discarded (unfeasible) 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f1/3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

### Ranking functions of CR f1(A,B,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f1(A,B,C) 


### Specialization of cost equations f0/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [5] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/3 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f1(A,B,C):
* Chain [4]: 0
  with precondition: [A=3000,C=2] 


#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B,C):
* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of f0(A,B,C): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [5] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of f0(A,B,C): 0 
Asymptotic class: constant 
* Total analysis performed in 5 ms.

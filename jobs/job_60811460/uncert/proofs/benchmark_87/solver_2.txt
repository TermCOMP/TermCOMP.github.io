Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [a/2]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [a_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into a/2
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations a/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [3] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of a/2 
* CEs [3] --> Loop 3 

### Ranking functions of CR a(A,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR a(A,C) 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [4] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

### Ranking functions of CR start(A,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(A,C) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of a(A,C):
* Chain [3]: 0
  with precondition: [C=2,A>=1] 


#### Cost of chains of start(A,C):
* Chain [4]: 0
  with precondition: [A>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of start(A,C): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [4] with precondition: [A>=1] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of start(A,C): 0 
Asymptotic class: constant 
* Total analysis performed in 6 ms.

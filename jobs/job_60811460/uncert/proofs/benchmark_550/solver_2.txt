Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f0/3]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f0_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f1/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f0/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C) 
* RF of phase [6]: [A]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C) 
* Partial RF of phase [6]:
  - RF of loop [6:1]:
    A


### Specialization of cost equations f1/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9,10,11] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f1/3 
* CEs [11] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 9 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 10 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 11 

### Ranking functions of CR f1(A,B,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f1(A,B,C) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B,C):
* Chain [[6],7]: 1*it(6)+0
  Such that:it(6) =< A

  with precondition: [C=2,0>=B+1,A>=1] 

* Chain [[5]]...: 1*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [B>=1,A>=1,C=2] 

* Chain [[5],7]: 1*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [C=2,A>=1,B>=1] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [C=2] 


#### Cost of chains of f1(A,B,C):
* Chain [11]: 0
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [10]: 1*s(1)+0
  Such that:s(1) =< A

  with precondition: [0>=B+1,A>=1] 

* Chain [9]: 1*s(2)+0
  with precondition: [A>=1,B>=1] 

* Chain [8]...: 1*s(3)+0
  with precondition: [A>=1,B>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of f1(A,B,C): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [11] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 
* Chain [10] with precondition: [0>=B+1,A>=1] 
    - Upper bound: A 
    - Complexity: n 
* Chain [9] with precondition: [A>=1,B>=1] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 
* Chain [8]... with precondition: [A>=1,B>=1] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity

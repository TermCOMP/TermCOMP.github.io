Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f0/3]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f0_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [start/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into start/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f0/3

* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C) 


### Specialization of cost equations start/3

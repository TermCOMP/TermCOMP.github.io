Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f2/4]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f2_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f0/4]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f2/4
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/4

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f2/4 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f2/4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f2(A,B,C,D) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f2(A,B,C,D) 
* Partial RF of phase [5,6]:
  - RF of loop [5:1]:
    A


### Specialization of cost equations f0/4 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/4 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 9 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C,D) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C,D) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f2(A,B,C,D):
* Chain [[5,6]]...: 1*it(5)+1*it(6)+0
  Such that:it(5) =< A

  with precondition: [A>=0,B>=C,D=2] 

* Chain [[5,6],7]: 1*it(5)+1*it(6)+0
  Such that:it(5) =< A

  with precondition: [D=2,A>=0,B>=C] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [D=2,A>=0,B>=C] 


#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B,C,D):
* Chain [9]: 1*s(3)+1*s(4)+0
  Such that:s(3) =< A

  with precondition: [A>=0,B>=C] 

* Chain [8]...: 1*s(5)+1*s(6)+0
  Such that:s(5) =< A

  with precondition: [A>=0,B>=C] 


Closed-form bounds of f0(A,B,C,D): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [9] with precondition: [A>=0,B>=C] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 
* Chain [8]... with precondition: [A>=0,B>=C] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 

### Maximum cost of f0(A,B,C,D): inf 
Asymptotic class: infinity

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f1/5]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f1_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f0/5]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/5
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/5

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f1/5 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f1/5 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f1(A,B,C,D,E) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f1(A,B,C,D,E) 
* Partial RF of phase [5,6]:
  - RF of loop [6:1]:
    A depends on loops [5:1] 


### Specialization of cost equations f0/5 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9,10] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/5 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 9 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 10 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C,D,E) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,C,D,E) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f1(A,B,C,D,E):
* Chain [[5,6]]...: 2*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [A>=1,E=2] 

* Chain [[5,6],7]: 2*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [E=2,A>=1] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [E=2] 


#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B,C,D,E):
* Chain [10]: 0
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [9]: 2*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [A>=1] 

* Chain [8]...: 2*s(2)+0
  with precondition: [A>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of f0(A,B,C,D,E): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [10] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 
* Chain [9] with precondition: [A>=1] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 
* Chain [8]... with precondition: [A>=1] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 

### Maximum cost of f0(A,B,C,D,E): inf 
Asymptotic class: infinity

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [f300/3]
1. non_recursive  : [f4/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into f4/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f4/3 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [3] 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [4] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f4/3 
* CEs [3] --> Loop 3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

### Ranking functions of CR f4(A,B,D) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f4(A,B,D) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f4(A,B,D):
* Chain [4]: 0
  with precondition: [0>=A+1] 

* Chain [3]: 0
  with precondition: [A>=0] 


Closed-form bounds of f4(A,B,D): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [4] with precondition: [0>=A+1] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 
* Chain [3] with precondition: [A>=0] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of f4(A,B,D): 0 
Asymptotic class: constant

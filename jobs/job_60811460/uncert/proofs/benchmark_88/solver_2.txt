* RF of phase [5,6]: [A+B-1]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR merge(A,B,C) 
* Partial RF of phase [5,6]:

### Specialization of cost equations start/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/3 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 8

Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of merge(A,B,C):
* Chain [[5,6],7]: 1*it(5)+1*it(6)+0
  Such that:it(5) =< A
it(6) =< B
aux(3) =< A+B
it(5) =< aux(3)
it(6) =< aux(3)

  with precondition: [C=2,A>=1,B>=1] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [C=2] 


#### Cost of chains of start(A,B,C):
* Chain [9]: 0
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [8]: 1*s(1)+1*s(2)+0
  Such that:s(1) =< A
s(3) =< A+B
s(2) =< B
s(1) =< s(3)
s(2) =< s(3)

  with precondition: [A>=1,B>=1]

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [l1/5,l2/5]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [l1_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [l0/5]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into l1/5
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into l0/5

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations l1/5 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of l1/5 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR l1(A,B,C,F,G) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR l1(A,B,C,F,G) 
* Partial RF of phase [5,6]:
  - RF of loop [6:1]:
    -A+1 depends on loops [5:1] 
    F-1


### Specialization of cost equations l0/5 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of l0/5 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 9 

### Ranking functions of CR l0(A,B,C,F,G) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR l0(A,B,C,F,G) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of l1(A,B,C,F,G):
* Chain [[5,6]]...: 1*it(5)+1*it(6)+0
  Such that:it(6) =< F

  with precondition: [G=2] 

* Chain [[5,6],7]: 1*it(5)+1*it(6)+0
  Such that:it(6) =< F

  with precondition: [G=2] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [G=2] 


#### Cost of chains of l0(A,B,C,F,G):
* Chain [9]: 1*s(3)+1*s(4)+0
  Such that:s(3) =< F

  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [8]...: 1*s(5)+1*s(6)+0
  Such that:s(5) =< F

  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of l0(A,B,C,F,G): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [9] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 
* Chain [8]... with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 

### Maximum cost of l0(A,B,C,F,G): inf 
Asymptotic class: infinity

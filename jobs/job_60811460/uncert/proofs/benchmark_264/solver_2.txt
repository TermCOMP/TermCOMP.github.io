Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f1/2]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f1_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f0/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/2
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f1/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is discarded (unfeasible) 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f1/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 6 

### Ranking functions of CR f1(A,B) 
* RF of phase [5]: [A-101]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f1(A,B) 
* Partial RF of phase [5]:
  - RF of loop [5:1]:
    A-101


### Specialization of cost equations f0/2 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [7,8] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/2 
* CEs [7,8] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f1(A,B):
* Chain [[5],6]: 1*it(5)+0
  Such that:it(5) =< A

  with precondition: [B=2,300>=A,A>=102] 

* Chain [6]: 0
  with precondition: [B=2,300>=A] 


#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B):
* Chain [7]: 300
  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of f0(A,B): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [7] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 300 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of f0(A,B): 300 
Asymptotic class: constant

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f1/5]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f30/3]
3. non_recursive  : [f1_loop_cont/4]
4. non_recursive  : [f20/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/5
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into f1_loop_cont/4
4. SCC is partially evaluated into f20/3

#### Cost of chains of f1_loop_cont(A,B,C,D):
* Chain [10]: 0
  with precondition: [A=2] 

* Chain [9]: 0
  with precondition: [A=3]

WORST_CASE(?,O(1))  

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [f20/3]
1. non_recursive  : [f0/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into f0/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f0/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [2] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f0/3 
* CEs [2] --> Loop 2 

### Ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,E) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f0(A,B,E) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f0(A,B,E):
* Chain [2]: 0
  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of f0(A,B,E): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [2] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of f0(A,B,E): 0 
Asymptotic class: constant 
* Total analysis performed in 1 ms.

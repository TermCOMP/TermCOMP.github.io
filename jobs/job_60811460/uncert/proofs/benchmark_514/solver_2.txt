Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f2/4]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f2_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f300/5]
4. non_recursive  : [f1/5]
Warning: the following predicates are never called:[f2/4]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f2/4
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
4. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/5

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f1/5 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [6] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f1/5 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 6

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f1(A,B,C,D,F) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f1(A,B,C,D,F):
* Chain [6]: 0

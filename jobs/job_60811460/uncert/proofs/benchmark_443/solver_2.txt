Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f2/4]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [f2_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [f300/5]
4. non_recursive  : [f1/5]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f2/4
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
4. SCC is partially evaluated into f1/5

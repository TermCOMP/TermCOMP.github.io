#### Cost of chains of f2(A,B,C):
* Chain [[5,6],7]: 1*it(5)+1*it(6)+0
  Such that:it(5) =< A

it(6) =< aux(3)

  with precondition: [C=2,A>=1,B>=1,A+B>=3] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [C=2,A>=1,B>=1] 


#### Cost of chains of f1(A,B,C):
* Chain [9]: 0
  with precondition: [A>=1,B>=1] 

* Chain [8]: 1*s(1)+1*s(2)+0
  Such that:s(1) =< A

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [l1/3]
1. non_recursive  : [exit_location/1]
2. non_recursive  : [l1_loop_cont/2]
3. non_recursive  : [l0/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into l1/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into l0/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations l1/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of l1/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 7 

### Ranking functions of CR l1(X1,X2,Y2) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR l1(X1,X2,Y2) 


### Specialization of cost equations l0/3 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [8,9,10] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of l0/3 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 9 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 10 

### Ranking functions of CR l0(X1,X2,Y2) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR l0(X1,X2,Y2) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of l1(X1,X2,Y2):
* Chain [[5,6]]...: 2*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [X1>=X2+1,X2>=1,Y2=2] 

* Chain [[5,6],7]: 2*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [Y2=2,X2>=1,X1>=X2+1] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [Y2=2] 


#### Cost of chains of l0(X1,X2,Y2):
* Chain [10]: 0
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [9]: 2*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [X2>=1,X1>=X2+1] 

* Chain [8]...: 2*s(2)+0
  with precondition: [X2>=1,X1>=X2+1] 


Closed-form bounds of l0(X1,X2,Y2): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [10] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 0

Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(X), Y) -> f(X, f(g(X), Y))



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(X), Y) -> f(X, f(g(X), Y))



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(g(X), Y) -> f(X, f(g(X), Y)) with rule f(g(X'), Y') -> f(X', f(g(X'), Y')) at position [] and matcher [X' / X, Y' / Y]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [1].

Context: f(X, [])

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

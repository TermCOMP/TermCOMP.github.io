Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x)) -> b(b(a(a(x))))



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x)) -> b(b(a(a(x))))



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

a(a(b(x'))) -> a(b(b(a(a(x'))))) with rule a(b(x'')) -> b(b(a(a(x'')))) at position [0] and matcher [x'' / x']

a(b(b(a(a(x'))))) -> b(b(a(a(b(a(a(x'))))))) with rule a(b(x)) -> b(b(a(a(x)))) at position [] and matcher [x / b(a(a(x')))]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [x' / a(a(x'))] occurs in the last term at position [0,0].

Context: b(b([]))

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

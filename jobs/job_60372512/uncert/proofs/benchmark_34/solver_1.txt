Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x)) -> f(g(x, x))
   g(0, 1) -> s(0)
   0 -> 1



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x)) -> f(g(x, x))
   g(0, 1) -> s(0)
   0 -> 1



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(g(0, 0)) -> f(g(0, 1)) with rule 0 -> 1 at position [0,1] and matcher [ ]

f(g(0, 1)) -> f(s(0)) with rule g(0, 1) -> s(0) at position [0] and matcher [ ]

f(s(0)) -> f(g(0, 0)) with rule f(s(x)) -> f(g(x, x)) at position [] and matcher [x / 0]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> f(a)
   b -> a



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> f(a)
   b -> a



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(X) -> f(a) with rule f(X') -> f(a) at position [] and matcher [X' / X]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [X / a] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

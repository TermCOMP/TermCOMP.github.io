Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(iterate, f), x) -> app(app(cons, x), app(app(iterate, f), app(f, x)))



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(iterate, f), x) -> app(app(cons, x), app(app(iterate, f), app(f, x)))



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

app(app(iterate, f), x) -> app(app(cons, x), app(app(iterate, f), app(f, x))) with rule app(app(iterate, f'), x') -> app(app(cons, x'), app(app(iterate, f'), app(f', x'))) at position [] and matcher [f' / f, x' / x]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [x / app(f, x)] occurs in the last term at position [1].

Context: app(app(cons, x), [])

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

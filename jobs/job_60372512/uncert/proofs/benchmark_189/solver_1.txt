Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> f(x, x)
   f(s(x), y) -> f(y, x)



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> f(x, x)
   f(s(x), y) -> f(y, x)



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(x, y) -> f(x, x) with rule f(x', y') -> f(x', x') at position [] and matcher [x' / x, y' / y]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [y / x] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

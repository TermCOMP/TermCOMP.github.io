Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(n__a, n__b, X) -> f(X, X, X)
   c -> a
   c -> b
   a -> n__a
   b -> n__b
   activate(n__a) -> a
   activate(n__b) -> b
   activate(X) -> X



Outermost Strategy.

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(n__a, n__b, X) -> f(X, X, X)
   c -> a
   c -> b
   a -> n__a
   b -> n__b
   activate(n__a) -> a
   activate(n__b) -> b
   activate(X) -> X



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(c, c, c) -> f(c, b, c) with rule c -> b at position [1] and matcher [ ]

f(c, b, c) -> f(c, n__b, c) with rule b -> n__b at position [1] and matcher [ ]

f(c, n__b, c) -> f(a, n__b, c) with rule c -> a at position [0] and matcher [ ]

f(a, n__b, c) -> f(n__a, n__b, c) with rule a -> n__a at position [0] and matcher [ ]

f(n__a, n__b, c) -> f(c, c, c) with rule f(n__a, n__b, X) -> f(X, X, X) at position [] and matcher [X / c]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

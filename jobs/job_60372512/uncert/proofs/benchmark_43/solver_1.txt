Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X)
   length -> 0
   length -> s(length1)
   length1 -> length



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X)
   length -> 0
   length -> s(length1)
   length1 -> length



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

length1 -> length with rule length1 -> length at position [] and matcher [ ]

length -> s(length1) with rule length -> s(length1) at position [] and matcher [ ]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [0].

Context: s([])

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

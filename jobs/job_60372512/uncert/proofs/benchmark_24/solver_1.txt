Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(0), g(x)) -> f(x, g(x))
   g(s(x)) -> g(x)



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(0), g(x)) -> f(x, g(x))
   g(s(x)) -> g(x)



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(s(0), g(s(0))) -> f(s(0), g(s(0))) with rule f(s(0), g(x)) -> f(x, g(x)) at position [] and matcher [x / s(0)]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

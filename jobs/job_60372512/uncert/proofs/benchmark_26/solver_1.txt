Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(x)))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x))))))



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(x)))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x))))))



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x'))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x'))))))))) with rule a(b(a(b(x'')))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x'')))))) at position [0,0,0] and matcher [x'' / x']

a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x'))))))))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x'))))))))))) with rule a(b(a(b(x)))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x)))))) at position [] and matcher [x / a(b(a(a(b(x')))))]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [x' / a(a(b(x')))] occurs in the last term at position [0].

Context: b([])

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> g(h(f(X)))



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> g(h(f(X)))



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(X) -> g(h(f(X))) with rule f(X') -> g(h(f(X'))) at position [] and matcher [X' / X]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [0,0].

Context: g(h([]))

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

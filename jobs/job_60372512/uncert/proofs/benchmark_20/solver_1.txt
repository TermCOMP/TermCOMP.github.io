Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 46 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x, y) -> f(x, y, x)
   f(0, 1, x) -> h(x, x)
   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y



Outermost Strategy.

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x, y) -> f(x, y, x)
   f(0, 1, x) -> h(x, x)
   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(g(0, 1), g(0, 1), g(0, 1)) -> f(g(0, 1), 1, g(0, 1)) with rule g(x, y') -> y' at position [1] and matcher [x / 0, y' / 1]

f(g(0, 1), 1, g(0, 1)) -> f(0, 1, g(0, 1)) with rule g(x, y) -> x at position [0] and matcher [x / 0, y / 1]

f(0, 1, g(0, 1)) -> h(g(0, 1), g(0, 1)) with rule f(0, 1, x) -> h(x, x) at position [] and matcher [x / g(0, 1)]

h(g(0, 1), g(0, 1)) -> f(g(0, 1), g(0, 1), g(0, 1)) with rule h(x, y) -> f(x, y, x) at position [] and matcher [x / g(0, 1), y / g(0, 1)]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

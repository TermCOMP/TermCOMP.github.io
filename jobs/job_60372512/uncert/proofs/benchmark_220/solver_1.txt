Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(X, Z) -> f(X, s(X), Z)
   f(X, Y, g(X, Y)) -> h(0, g(X, Y))
   g(0, Y) -> 0
   g(X, s(Y)) -> g(X, Y)



Outermost Strategy.

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(X, Z) -> f(X, s(X), Z)
   f(X, Y, g(X, Y)) -> h(0, g(X, Y))
   g(0, Y) -> 0
   g(X, s(Y)) -> g(X, Y)



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(0, s(0), g(0, s(0))) -> h(0, g(0, s(0))) with rule f(X, Y, g(X, Y)) -> h(0, g(X, Y)) at position [] and matcher [X / 0, Y / s(0)]

h(0, g(0, s(0))) -> f(0, s(0), g(0, s(0))) with rule h(X, Z) -> f(X, s(X), Z) at position [] and matcher [X / 0, Z / g(0, s(0))]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

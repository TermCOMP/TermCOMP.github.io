Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, a) -> f(x, b)
   b -> a
   f(a, x) -> a
   f(b, x) -> a
   f(f(x, y), z) -> a



Outermost Strategy.

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, a) -> f(x, b)
   b -> a
   f(a, x) -> a
   f(b, x) -> a
   f(f(x, y), z) -> a



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(x, b) -> f(x, a) with rule b -> a at position [1] and matcher [ ]

f(x, a) -> f(x, b) with rule f(x', a) -> f(x', b) at position [] and matcher [x' / x]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

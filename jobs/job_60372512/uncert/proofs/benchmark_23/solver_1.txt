Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> f(g(x, y), g(x, y), g(x, y), h(x))
   g(0, 1) -> 0
   g(0, 1) -> 1
   h(g(x, y)) -> h(x)



Outermost Strategy.

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> f(g(x, y), g(x, y), g(x, y), h(x))
   g(0, 1) -> 0
   g(0, 1) -> 1
   h(g(x, y)) -> h(x)



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(g(0, 1), g(0, 1), g(0, 1), h(0)) -> f(g(0, 1), 1, g(0, 1), h(0)) with rule g(0, 1) -> 1 at position [1] and matcher [ ]

f(g(0, 1), 1, g(0, 1), h(0)) -> f(0, 1, g(0, 1), h(0)) with rule g(0, 1) -> 0 at position [0] and matcher [ ]

f(0, 1, g(0, 1), h(0)) -> f(g(0, 1), g(0, 1), g(0, 1), h(0)) with rule f(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> f(g(x, y), g(x, y), g(x, y), h(x)) at position [] and matcher [x / 0, y / 1, z / h(0)]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

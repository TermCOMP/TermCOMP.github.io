Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X)) -> f(1, g(X))
   g(1) -> g(0)



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X)) -> f(1, g(X))
   g(1) -> g(0)



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(1, g(1)) -> f(1, g(1)) with rule f(X, g(X)) -> f(1, g(X)) at position [] and matcher [X / 1]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

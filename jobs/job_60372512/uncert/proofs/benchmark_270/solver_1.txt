Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(x)) -> f(g(g(x)))
   g(g(g(x))) -> a



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(x)) -> f(g(g(x)))
   g(g(g(x))) -> a



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(g(x)) -> f(g(g(x))) with rule f(g(x')) -> f(g(g(x'))) at position [] and matcher [x' / x]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [x / g(x)] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

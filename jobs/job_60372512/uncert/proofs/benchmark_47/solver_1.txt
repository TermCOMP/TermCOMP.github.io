Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 69 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(X) -> g(X, X)
   g(a, X) -> f(b, activate(X))
   f(X, X) -> h(a)
   a -> b
   activate(X) -> X



Outermost Strategy.

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(X) -> g(X, X)
   g(a, X) -> f(b, activate(X))
   f(X, X) -> h(a)
   a -> b
   activate(X) -> X



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

g(a, a) -> f(b, activate(a)) with rule g(a, X) -> f(b, activate(X)) at position [] and matcher [X / a]

f(b, activate(a)) -> f(b, a) with rule activate(X) -> X at position [1] and matcher [X / a]

f(b, a) -> f(b, b) with rule a -> b at position [1] and matcher [ ]

f(b, b) -> h(a) with rule f(X, X) -> h(a) at position [] and matcher [X / b]

h(a) -> g(a, a) with rule h(X) -> g(X, X) at position [] and matcher [X / a]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

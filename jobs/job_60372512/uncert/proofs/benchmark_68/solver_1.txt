Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)
   c -> d
   h(d) -> g(c)



Outermost Strategy.

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)
   c -> d
   h(d) -> g(c)



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

h(c) -> h(d) with rule c -> d at position [0] and matcher [ ]

h(d) -> g(c) with rule h(d) -> g(c) at position [] and matcher [ ]

g(c) -> h(c) with rule g(X) -> h(X) at position [] and matcher [X / c]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> cons(0, f(s(0)))
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))
   p(s(0)) -> 0



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> cons(0, f(s(0)))
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))
   p(s(0)) -> 0



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0))) with rule f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0))) at position [] and matcher [ ]

f(p(s(0))) -> f(0) with rule p(s(0)) -> 0 at position [0] and matcher [ ]

f(0) -> cons(0, f(s(0))) with rule f(0) -> cons(0, f(s(0))) at position [] and matcher [ ]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [1].

Context: cons(0, [])

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(X) -> g(X)
   g(a) -> f(b)
   f(X) -> h(a)
   a -> b



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(X) -> g(X)
   g(a) -> f(b)
   f(X) -> h(a)
   a -> b



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

g(a) -> f(b) with rule g(a) -> f(b) at position [] and matcher [ ]

f(b) -> h(a) with rule f(X) -> h(a) at position [] and matcher [X / b]

h(a) -> g(a) with rule h(X) -> g(X) at position [] and matcher [X / a]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

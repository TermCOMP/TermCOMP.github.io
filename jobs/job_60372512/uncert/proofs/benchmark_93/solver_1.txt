Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   after(s(N), cons(X)) -> after(N, XS)
   from(X) -> cons(X)
   after(0, XS) -> XS



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   after(s(N), cons(X)) -> after(N, XS)
   from(X) -> cons(X)
   after(0, XS) -> XS



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

after(s(N), cons(X)) -> after(N, after(s(N), cons(X))) with rule after(s(N''), cons(X'')) -> after(N'', XS) at position [] and matcher [N'' / N, X'' / X, XS / after(s(N), cons(X))]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [1].

Context: after(N, [])

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

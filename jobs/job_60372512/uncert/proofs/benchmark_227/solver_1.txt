Outermost Termination of the given OTRS could be disproven:

(0) OTRS
(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(1, x) -> +(+(0, 1), x)
   +(0, x) -> x



Outermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) OutermostNonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
Term rewrite system R:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(1, x) -> +(+(0, 1), x)
   +(0, x) -> x



Outermost Strategy.

---------- Loop: ----------

+(+(0, 1), x) -> +(1, x) with rule +(0, x') -> x' at position [0] and matcher [x' / 1]

+(1, x) -> +(+(0, 1), x) with rule +(1, x') -> +(+(0, 1), x') at position [] and matcher [x' / x]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

We used [THIEMANN_LOOPS_UNDER_STRATEGIES] to show that this Loop is an Outermost-Loop.

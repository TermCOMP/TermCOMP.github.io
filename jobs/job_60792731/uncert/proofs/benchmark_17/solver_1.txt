   plus(1(x), 1(y)) -> j(plus(1(S), plus(x, y)))
   plus(j(x), j(y)) -> 1(plus(j(S), plus(x, y)))
   plus(plus(1(x), 1(y)), ext) -> plus(j(plus(1(S), plus(x, y))), ext)
   plus(plus(j(x), j(y)), ext) -> plus(1(plus(j(S), plus(x, y))), ext)

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))
   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)

The set E# consists of the following equations:

   PLUS(x, y) == PLUS(y, x)
   PLUS(plus(x, y), z) == PLUS(x, plus(y, z))

We have to consider all minimal (P,E#,R,E)-chains

(17) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,E#,R,E) chain.

Obligation:
Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(S) -> S
   plus(S, x) -> x
   plus(0(x), 0(y)) -> 0(plus(x, y))
   plus(0(x), 1(y)) -> 1(plus(x, y))
   plus(1(x), 1(y)) -> 0(plus(x, plus(y, 1(S))))
   times(S, x) -> S
   times(0(x), y) -> 0(times(x, y))
   times(1(x), y) -> plus(0(times(x, y)), y)

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   times(x, y) == times(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))
   times(times(x, y), z) == times(x, times(y, z))

(1) RRRPoloETRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following E TRS is given: Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(S) -> S
   plus(S, x) -> x
   plus(0(x), 0(y)) -> 0(plus(x, y))
   plus(0(x), 1(y)) -> 1(plus(x, y))
   plus(1(x), 1(y)) -> 0(plus(x, plus(y, 1(S))))
   times(S, x) -> S
   times(0(x), y) -> 0(times(x, y))
   times(1(x), y) -> plus(0(times(x, y)), y)

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   times(x, y) == times(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))
   times(times(x, y), z) == times(x, times(y, z))

The following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly by a polynomial ordering:

   plus(S, x) -> x
   times(S, x) -> S
   times(1(x), y) -> plus(0(times(x, y)), y)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(S) = 1
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(times(x_1, x_2)) = 3 + 3*x_1 + 2*x_1*x_2 + 3*x_2

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   times(x, y) == times(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))
   times(times(x, y), z) == times(x, times(y, z))

The following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly by a polynomial ordering:

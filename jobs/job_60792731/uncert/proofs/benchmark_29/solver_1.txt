   app(l, nil) -> l
   app(cons(x, l), k) -> cons(x, app(l, k))
   sum(cons(x, nil)) -> cons(x, nil)

   plus(0, y) -> y
   plus(s(x), y) -> s(plus(x, y))

(1) RRRPoloETRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following E TRS is given: Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(nil, k) -> k
   app(l, nil) -> l
   app(cons(x, l), k) -> cons(x, app(l, k))
   sum(cons(x, nil)) -> cons(x, nil)

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))

The following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly by a polynomial ordering:

   app(cons(x, l), k) -> cons(x, app(l, k))
   plus(0, y) -> y
   plus(s(x), y) -> s(plus(x, y))
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(app(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_1*x_2 + x_2
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + x_1*x_2 + 2*x_2
   POL(nil) = 0
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + x_1*x_2 + 2*x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = 3 + 2*x_1
   POL(sum(x_1)) = x_1

   sum(app(l, cons(x, cons(y, k)))) -> sum(app(l, sum(cons(x, cons(y, k)))))

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))

E# is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,E#,R,E)-chains

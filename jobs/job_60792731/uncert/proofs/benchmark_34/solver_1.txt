The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))

E# is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,E#,R,E)-chains

(57) EDPPoloProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [DA_STEIN] with a polynomial ordering [POLO]. All Dependency Pairs of this DP problem can be strictly oriented.


   QUOT(s(x), s(y)) -> QUOT(minus(x, y), s(y))
With the implicit AFS we had to orient the following set of usable rules of R non-strictly.


   minus(minus(x, y), z) -> minus(x, plus(y, z))
   minus(s(x), s(y)) -> minus(x, y)
   minus(x, 0) -> x
There is no equation of E#.


With the implicit AFS there is no usable equation of E.


Used ordering: POLO with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(QUOT(x_1, x_2)) = x_1
   POL(minus(x_1, x_2)) = x_1
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1

The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,E#,R,E) chain.

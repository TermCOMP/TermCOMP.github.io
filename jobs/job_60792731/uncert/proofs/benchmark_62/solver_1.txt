Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(plus(x, y)) -> plus(f(x), y)
   plus(g(x), y) -> g(plus(x, y))
   plus(f(a), g(b)) -> plus(f(b), g(a))
   h(a, b) -> h(b, a)
   h(a, g(g(a))) -> h(g(a), f(a))
   h(g(a), a) -> h(a, g(b))
   h(g(a), b) -> h(a, g(a))

The following E TRS is given: Equational rewrite system:

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))

The following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly by a polynomial ordering:

   f(plus(x, y)) -> plus(f(x), y)
   plus(g(x), y) -> g(plus(x, y))
   h(a, g(g(a))) -> h(g(a), f(a))

Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 0
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + 3*x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = 3 + x_1

(0)
Obligation:
Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(plus(a, a)) -> plus(f(a), f(a))
   plus(f(a), f(a)) -> plus(a, f(f(a)))

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))


----------------------------------------

(1) RRRPoloETRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following E TRS is given: Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(plus(a, a)) -> plus(f(a), f(a))
   plus(f(a), f(a)) -> plus(a, f(f(a)))

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))

The following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly by a polynomial ordering:

   f(plus(a, a)) -> plus(f(a), f(a))
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 3*x_1
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = 3 + x_1 + x_2




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   plus(f(a), f(a)) -> plus(a, f(f(a)))

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))


----------------------------------------

(3) RRRPoloETRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following E TRS is given: Equational rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   plus(f(a), f(a)) -> plus(a, f(f(a)))

The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))

The following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly by a polynomial ordering:

   plus(f(a), f(a)) -> plus(a, f(f(a)))
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 1 + x_1^2
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_1*x_2 + 2*x_2




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Equational rewrite system:
R is empty.
The set E consists of the following equations:

   plus(x, y) == plus(y, x)
   plus(plus(x, y), z) == plus(x, plus(y, z))


----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

(6)
YES

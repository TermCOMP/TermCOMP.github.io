Complexity of the given CpxPTRS could be proven:

(0) CpxPTRS
(1) CpxPTRS_ToInnermostProof [BOTH BOUNDS(ID, ID), 0 ms]
(2) CpxPTRS
(3) CpxPTRS_DirectPoloProof [FINISHED, 11 ms]
(4) BOUNDS(1, EXP)


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Probabilistic term rewrite system:
The TRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   createG(xs) -> 1 / 2 : xs || 1 / 2 : createG(addEdge(0, 0, xs))
   addEdge(x, y, xs) -> 1 / 3 : cons(edge(x, y), xs) || 1 / 3 : addEdge(s(x), y, xs) || 1 / 3 : addEdge(x, s(y), xs)

and uses the full rewrite strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) CpxPTRS_ToInnermostProof (BOTH BOUNDS(ID, ID))
Switched from non-innermost to innermost rewriting[FoSSaCS24].

The system is non-overlapping, left-linear and right-linear, so its complexity is the same as its innermost complexity.


----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Probabilistic term rewrite system:
The TRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   createG(xs) -> 1 / 2 : xs || 1 / 2 : createG(addEdge(0, 0, xs))
   addEdge(x, y, xs) -> 1 / 3 : cons(edge(x, y), xs) || 1 / 3 : addEdge(s(x), y, xs) || 1 / 3 : addEdge(x, s(y), xs)

and uses the innermost rewrite strategy.

----------------------------------------

(3) CpxPTRS_DirectPoloProof (FINISHED)


We use the direct application of polynomial interpretations [ADY19].
Using the following Interpretation: 
Resulting in the following upper complexity bound: EXPPolynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(addEdge(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 1 + x_1 + 2*x_2 + x_3
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(createG(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(edge(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1

----------------------------------------

(4)

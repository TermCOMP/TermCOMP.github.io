Complexity of the given CpxPTRS could be proven:

(0) CpxPTRS
(1) CpxPTRS_ToInnermostProof [BOTH BOUNDS(ID, ID), 0 ms]
(2) CpxPTRS
(3) CpxPTRS_DirectPoloProof [FINISHED, 7 ms]
(4) BOUNDS(1, 1)


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Probabilistic term rewrite system:
The TRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   aShoot -> 3 / 7 : aWon || 4 / 7 : bShoot
   bShoot -> 1 / 4 : bWon || 3 / 4 : aShoot

and uses the full rewrite strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) CpxPTRS_ToInnermostProof (BOTH BOUNDS(ID, ID))
Switched from non-innermost to innermost rewriting[FoSSaCS24].

The system is non-overlapping, left-linear and right-linear, so its complexity is the same as its innermost complexity.


----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Probabilistic term rewrite system:
The TRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   aShoot -> 3 / 7 : aWon || 4 / 7 : bShoot
   bShoot -> 1 / 4 : bWon || 3 / 4 : aShoot

and uses the innermost rewrite strategy.

----------------------------------------

(3) CpxPTRS_DirectPoloProof (FINISHED)


We use the direct application of polynomial interpretations [ADY19].
Using the following Interpretation: 
Resulting in the following upper complexity bound: 1Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(aShoot) = 6
   POL(aWon) = 0
   POL(bShoot) = 8
   POL(bWon) = 1

----------------------------------------

(4)
BOUNDS(1, 1)

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

reverse_in_2: (b,f)

app_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   reverse_in_ga(.(X, Xs), Ys) -> U2_ga(X, Xs, Ys, reverse_in_ga(Xs, Zs))
   reverse_in_ga([], []) -> reverse_out_ga([], [])
   U2_ga(X, Xs, Ys, reverse_out_ga(Xs, Zs)) -> U3_ga(X, Xs, Ys, app_in_gga(Zs, .(X, []), Ys))
   app_in_gga(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs)) -> U1_gga(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_in_gga(Xs, Ys, Zs))
   app_in_gga([], Ys, Ys) -> app_out_gga([], Ys, Ys)
   U1_gga(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_out_gga(Xs, Ys, Zs)) -> app_out_gga(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs))
   U3_ga(X, Xs, Ys, app_out_gga(Zs, .(X, []), Ys)) -> reverse_out_ga(.(X, Xs), Ys)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
reverse_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  reverse_in_ga(x1)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U2_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U2_ga(x1, x2, x4)

[]  =  []

reverse_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  reverse_out_ga(x1, x2)

U3_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U3_ga(x1, x2, x4)

app_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_in_gga(x1, x2)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x5)

app_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)

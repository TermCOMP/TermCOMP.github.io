We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

qs_in_2: (f,b) (f,f)

part_in_4: (f,f,f,f) (b,f,f,f)

less_in_2: (f,f) (b,f)

app_in_3: (f,f,f) (f,f,b)

(19) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = APP_IN_AAA evaluates to  t =APP_IN_AAA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from APP_IN_AAA to APP_IN_AAA.

(37) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = PART_IN_GAAA(X) evaluates to  t =PART_IN_GAAA(X)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from PART_IN_GAAA(X) to PART_IN_GAAA(X).

We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = LESS_IN_AA evaluates to  t =LESS_IN_AA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

(76) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = APP_IN_AAA evaluates to  t =APP_IN_AAA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from APP_IN_AAA to APP_IN_AAA.

(94) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = PART_IN_GAAA(X) evaluates to  t =PART_IN_GAAA(X)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

(108) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = PART_IN_AAAA evaluates to  t =PART_IN_AAAA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from PART_IN_AAAA to PART_IN_AAAA.

(129) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = F1065_IN evaluates to  t =F1065_IN

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from F1065_IN to F1065_IN.

(150) NonLoopProof (COMPLETE)
By Theorem 8 [NONLOOP] we deduce infiniteness of the QDP.
We apply the theorem with m = 1, b = 0, 
?' = [ ], and ?' = [ ] on the rule
F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ]
This rule is correct for the QDP as the following derivation shows:

F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ]
    by Narrowing at position: []
    F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> F997_IN[ ]^n[ ]
        by Rule from TRS P

    F997_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ]
        by Narrowing at position: []
        F997_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> F1056_IN[ ]^n[ ]
            by Rule from TRS P

        F1056_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ]
            by Narrowing at position: []
            F1056_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> U21^1(f597_out1)[ ]^n[ ]
                by Narrowing at position: [0]
                F1056_IN[ ]^n[ ] -> U21^1(f597_in)[ ]^n[ ]
                    by Rule from TRS P

                f597_in[ ]^n[ ] -> f597_out1[ ]^n[ ]
                    by Rule from TRS R

            U21^1(f597_out1)[ ]^n[ ] -> F1059_IN[ ]^n[ ]

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APPI_IN_GAGG(.(X1, X2), X4, .(X1, X5)) -> APPI_IN_GAGG(X2, X4, X5)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 >= 2, 3 > 3

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*U3_GGAA(X1, X2, X3, lesscA_out_gg(X1, X2)) -> PARTB_IN_GGAA(X1, X3)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 4 > 1, 3 >= 2

----------------------------------------

(223) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = APPE_IN_AAAA evaluates to  t =APPE_IN_AAAA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from APPE_IN_AAAA to APPE_IN_AAAA.

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   lesscA_in_ga(x0)
   U63_ga(x0, x1)

We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(241) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = PARTB_IN_GAAA(X1) evaluates to  t =PARTB_IN_GAAA(X1)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from PARTB_IN_GAAA(X1) to PARTB_IN_GAAA(X1).

(248) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = LESSA_IN_AA evaluates to  t =LESSA_IN_AA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from LESSA_IN_AA to LESSA_IN_AA.

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   PARTC_IN_AAAA(X1, .(X2, X3), X4, .(X2, X5)) -> PARTC_IN_AAAA(X1, X3, X4, X5)

R is empty.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   PARTC_IN_AAAA -> PARTC_IN_AAAA

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(255) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = PARTC_IN_AAAA evaluates to  t =PARTC_IN_AAAA

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from PARTC_IN_AAAA to PARTC_IN_AAAA.

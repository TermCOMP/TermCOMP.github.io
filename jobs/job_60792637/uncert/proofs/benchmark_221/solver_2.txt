----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

plus_in_3: (b,f,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   plus_in_gaa(0, Y, Y) -> plus_out_gaa(0, Y, Y)
   plus_in_gaa(s(X), Y, Z) -> U1_gaa(X, Y, Z, plus_in_gaa(X, s(Y), Z))
   U1_gaa(X, Y, Z, plus_out_gaa(X, s(Y), Z)) -> plus_out_gaa(s(X), Y, Z)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
plus_in_gaa(x1, x2, x3)  =  plus_in_gaa(x1)

0  =  0

plus_out_gaa(x1, x2, x3)  =  plus_out_gaa

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_gaa(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_gaa(x4)





Infinitary Constructor Rewriting Termination of PiTRS implies Termination of Prolog

   U1_gaa(X, Y, Z, plus_out_gaa(X, s(Y), Z)) -> plus_out_gaa(s(X), Y, Z)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
plus_in_gaa(x1, x2, x3)  =  plus_in_gaa(x1)

0  =  0

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LOPSTR] we result in the following initial DP problem:
Pi DP problem:

   plus_in_gaa(0, Y, Y) -> plus_out_gaa(0, Y, Y)
   plus_in_gaa(s(X), Y, Z) -> U1_gaa(X, Y, Z, plus_in_gaa(X, s(Y), Z))
   U1_gaa(X, Y, Z, plus_out_gaa(X, s(Y), Z)) -> plus_out_gaa(s(X), Y, Z)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
plus_in_gaa(x1, x2, x3)  =  plus_in_gaa(x1)

0  =  0

plus_out_gaa(x1, x2, x3)  =  plus_out_gaa

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_gaa(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_gaa(x4)

PLUS_IN_GAA(x1, x2, x3)  =  PLUS_IN_GAA(x1)

U1_GAA(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_GAA(x4)

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

tree_member_in_2: (b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   tree_member_in_ga(X, tree(X, X1, X2)) -> tree_member_out_ga(X, tree(X, X1, X2))
   tree_member_in_ga(X, tree(X3, Left, X4)) -> U1_ga(X, X3, Left, X4, tree_member_in_ga(X, Left))
   tree_member_in_ga(X, tree(X5, X6, Right)) -> U2_ga(X, X5, X6, Right, tree_member_in_ga(X, Right))
   U2_ga(X, X5, X6, Right, tree_member_out_ga(X, Right)) -> tree_member_out_ga(X, tree(X5, X6, Right))
   U1_ga(X, X3, Left, X4, tree_member_out_ga(X, Left)) -> tree_member_out_ga(X, tree(X3, Left, X4))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
tree_member_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  tree_member_in_ga(x1)

tree_member_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  tree_member_out_ga(x1)

U1_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_ga(x1, x5)

U2_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U2_ga(x1, x5)

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F2_IN(T34) -> F2_IN(T34)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f2_in(T15) -> f2_out1
   f2_in(T34) -> U1(f2_in(T34), T34)
   U1(f2_out1, T34) -> f2_out1
   f2_in(T53) -> U2(f2_in(T53), T53)
   U2(f2_out1, T53) -> f2_out1

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(27) MNOCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the modular non-overlap check [LPAR04] to enlarge Q to all left-hand sides of R.

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F2_IN(T34) -> F2_IN(T34)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f2_in(T15) -> f2_out1
   f2_in(T34) -> U1(f2_in(T34), T34)
   U1(f2_out1, T34) -> f2_out1
   f2_in(T53) -> U2(f2_in(T53), T53)
   U2(f2_out1, T53) -> f2_out1

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f2_in(x0)
   U1(f2_out1, x0)
   U2(f2_out1, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(29) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F2_IN(T34) -> F2_IN(T34)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   U1(f2_out1, x0)
   U2(f2_out1, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(31) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f2_in(x0)
   U1(f2_out1, x0)
   U2(f2_out1, x0)

----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

less_in_2: (b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   less_in_ga(0, s(X1)) -> less_out_ga(0, s(X1))
   less_in_ga(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ga(X, Y, less_in_ga(X, Y))
   U1_ga(X, Y, less_out_ga(X, Y)) -> less_out_ga(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ga(x1)

0  =  0

less_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ga(x1)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_ga(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_ga(x1, x3)





Infinitary Constructor Rewriting Termination of PiTRS implies Termination of Prolog

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   less_in_ga(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ga(X, Y, less_in_ga(X, Y))
   U1_ga(X, Y, less_out_ga(X, Y)) -> less_out_ga(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ga(x1)

0  =  0

less_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ga(x1)

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LOPSTR] we result in the following initial DP problem:
Pi DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   LESS_IN_GA(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_GA(X, Y, less_in_ga(X, Y))
   LESS_IN_GA(s(X), s(Y)) -> LESS_IN_GA(X, Y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   less_in_ga(0, s(X1)) -> less_out_ga(0, s(X1))
   less_in_ga(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ga(X, Y, less_in_ga(X, Y))
   U1_ga(X, Y, less_out_ga(X, Y)) -> less_out_ga(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ga(x1)

0  =  0

less_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ga(x1)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_ga(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_ga(x1, x3)

LESS_IN_GA(x1, x2)  =  LESS_IN_GA(x1)

U1_GA(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_GA(x1, x3)

   less_in_ga(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ga(X, Y, less_in_ga(X, Y))
   U1_ga(X, Y, less_out_ga(X, Y)) -> less_out_ga(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ga(x1)

0  =  0

less_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ga(x1)

   U1_ga(X, Y, less_out_ga(X, Y)) -> less_out_ga(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*LESS_IN_GA(s(X)) -> LESS_IN_GA(X)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

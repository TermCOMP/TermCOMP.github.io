----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

reverse_in_3: (b,f,b)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   reverse_in_gag([], X, X) -> reverse_out_gag([], X, X)
   reverse_in_gag(.(X, Y), Z, U) -> U1_gag(X, Y, Z, U, reverse_in_gag(Y, Z, .(X, U)))
   U1_gag(X, Y, Z, U, reverse_out_gag(Y, Z, .(X, U))) -> reverse_out_gag(.(X, Y), Z, U)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
reverse_in_gag(x1, x2, x3)  =  reverse_in_gag(x1, x3)

[]  =  []

reverse_out_gag(x1, x2, x3)  =  reverse_out_gag(x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_gag(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gag(x5)

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

perm_in_2: (b,f)

app_in_3: (f,f,b) (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   perm_in_ga(Xs, .(X, Ys)) -> U1_ga(Xs, X, Ys, app_in_aag(X1s, .(X, X2s), Xs))
   app_in_aag(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs)) -> U4_aag(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_in_aag(Xs, Ys, Zs))
   app_in_aag([], Ys, Ys) -> app_out_aag([], Ys, Ys)
   U4_aag(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_out_aag(Xs, Ys, Zs)) -> app_out_aag(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs))
   U1_ga(Xs, X, Ys, app_out_aag(X1s, .(X, X2s), Xs)) -> U2_ga(Xs, X, Ys, app_in_gga(X1s, X2s, Zs))

   U3_ga(Xs, X, Ys, perm_out_ga(Zs, Ys)) -> perm_out_ga(Xs, .(X, Ys))

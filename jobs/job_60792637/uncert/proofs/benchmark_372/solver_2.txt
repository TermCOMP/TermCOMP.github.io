----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

rotate_in_2: (b,f)

append_in_3: (f,f,b) (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   rotate_in_ga(X, Y) -> U1_ga(X, Y, append_in_aag(A, B, X))
   append_in_aag(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs)) -> U3_aag(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, append_in_aag(Xs, Ys, Zs))

   U2_ga(X, Y, append_out_gga(B, A, Y)) -> rotate_out_ga(X, Y)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
rotate_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  rotate_in_ga(x1)

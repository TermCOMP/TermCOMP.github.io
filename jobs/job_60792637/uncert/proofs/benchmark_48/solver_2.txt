----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

rev_in_2: (b,f)

app_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   rev_in_ga([], []) -> rev_out_ga([], [])
   rev_in_ga(.(X, Xs), Ys) -> U1_ga(X, Xs, Ys, rev_in_ga(Xs, Zs))
   U1_ga(X, Xs, Ys, rev_out_ga(Xs, Zs)) -> U2_ga(X, Xs, Ys, app_in_gga(Zs, .(X, []), Ys))
   app_in_gga([], X, X) -> app_out_gga([], X, X)
   app_in_gga(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs)) -> U3_gga(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_in_gga(Xs, Ys, Zs))
   U3_gga(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_out_gga(Xs, Ys, Zs)) -> app_out_gga(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs))
   U2_ga(X, Xs, Ys, app_out_gga(Zs, .(X, []), Ys)) -> rev_out_ga(.(X, Xs), Ys)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
rev_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  rev_in_ga(x1)

[]  =  []

rev_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  rev_out_ga(x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_ga(x1, x4)

U2_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U2_ga(x4)

app_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_in_gga(x1, x2)

app_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_out_gga(x3)

U3_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U3_gga(x1, x5)

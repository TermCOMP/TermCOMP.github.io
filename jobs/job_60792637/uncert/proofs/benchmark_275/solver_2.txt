(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

ack_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   ack_in_gga(0, N, s(N)) -> ack_out_gga(0, N, s(N))
   ack_in_gga(s(M), 0, A) -> U1_gga(M, A, ack_in_gga(M, s(0), A))
   ack_in_gga(s(M), s(N), A) -> U2_gga(M, N, A, ack_in_gga(s(M), N, A1))
   U2_gga(M, N, A, ack_out_gga(s(M), N, A1)) -> U3_gga(M, N, A, ack_in_gga(M, A1, A))
   U3_gga(M, N, A, ack_out_gga(M, A1, A)) -> ack_out_gga(s(M), s(N), A)
   U1_gga(M, A, ack_out_gga(M, s(0), A)) -> ack_out_gga(s(M), 0, A)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
ack_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  ack_in_gga(x1, x2)

0  =  0

ack_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  ack_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_gga(x1, x3)

U2_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U2_gga(x1, x2, x4)

U3_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U3_gga(x1, x2, x4)

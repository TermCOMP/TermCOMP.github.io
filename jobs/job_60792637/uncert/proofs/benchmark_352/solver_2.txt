(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

f_in_3: (b,b,f)

g_in_4: (b,b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f_in_gga([], RES, RES) -> f_out_gga([], RES, RES)
   f_in_gga(.(Head, Tail), X, RES) -> U1_gga(Head, Tail, X, RES, g_in_ggga(Tail, X, .(Head, Tail), RES))
   g_in_ggga(A, B, C, RES) -> U2_ggga(A, B, C, RES, f_in_gga(A, .(B, C), RES))
   U2_ggga(A, B, C, RES, f_out_gga(A, .(B, C), RES)) -> g_out_ggga(A, B, C, RES)
   U1_gga(Head, Tail, X, RES, g_out_ggga(Tail, X, .(Head, Tail), RES)) -> f_out_gga(.(Head, Tail), X, RES)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
f_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  f_in_gga(x1, x2)

[]  =  []

f_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  f_out_gga(x3)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gga(x5)

g_in_ggga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  g_in_ggga(x1, x2, x3)

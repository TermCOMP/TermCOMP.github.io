Query: som3(g,a,a)
----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

som3_in_3: (b,f,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   som3_in_gaa([], Bs, Bs) -> som3_out_gaa([], Bs, Bs)
   som3_in_gaa(As, [], As) -> som3_out_gaa(As, [], As)
   som3_in_gaa(.(A, As), .(B, Bs), .(+(A, B), Cs)) -> U1_gaa(A, As, B, Bs, Cs, som3_in_gaa(As, Bs, Cs))
   U1_gaa(A, As, B, Bs, Cs, som3_out_gaa(As, Bs, Cs)) -> som3_out_gaa(.(A, As), .(B, Bs), .(+(A, B), Cs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
som3_in_gaa(x1, x2, x3)  =  som3_in_gaa(x1)

[]  =  []

som3_out_gaa(x1, x2, x3)  =  som3_out_gaa(x1)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_gaa(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)  =  U1_gaa(x1, x2, x6)

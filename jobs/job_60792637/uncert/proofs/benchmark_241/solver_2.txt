----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

app2_in_3: (f,b,b)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app2_in_agg(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs)) -> U2_agg(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app2_in_agg(Xs, Ys, Zs))
   app2_in_agg([], Ys, Ys) -> app2_out_agg([], Ys, Ys)
   U2_agg(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app2_out_agg(Xs, Ys, Zs)) -> app2_out_agg(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
app2_in_agg(x1, x2, x3)  =  app2_in_agg(x2, x3)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U2_agg(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U2_agg(x1, x3, x4, x5)

app2_out_agg(x1, x2, x3)  =  app2_out_agg(x1, x2, x3)

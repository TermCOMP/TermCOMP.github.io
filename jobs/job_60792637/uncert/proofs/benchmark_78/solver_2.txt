----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

sum_in_3: (f,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   sum_in_aga(X, 0, X) -> sum_out_aga(X, 0, X)
   sum_in_aga(X, s(Y), s(Z)) -> U1_aga(X, Y, Z, sum_in_aga(X, Y, Z))
   U1_aga(X, Y, Z, sum_out_aga(X, Y, Z)) -> sum_out_aga(X, s(Y), s(Z))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
sum_in_aga(x1, x2, x3)  =  sum_in_aga(x2)

0  =  0

sum_out_aga(x1, x2, x3)  =  sum_out_aga

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_aga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_aga(x4)





Infinitary Constructor Rewriting Termination of PiTRS implies Termination of Prolog

   U1_aga(X, Y, Z, sum_out_aga(X, Y, Z)) -> sum_out_aga(X, s(Y), s(Z))

Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LOPSTR] we result in the following initial DP problem:
Pi DP problem:

   U1_aga(X, Y, Z, sum_out_aga(X, Y, Z)) -> sum_out_aga(X, s(Y), s(Z))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
sum_in_aga(x1, x2, x3)  =  sum_in_aga(x2)

0  =  0

sum_out_aga(x1, x2, x3)  =  sum_out_aga

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_aga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_aga(x4)

SUM_IN_AGA(x1, x2, x3)  =  SUM_IN_AGA(x2)

U1_AGA(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_AGA(x4)

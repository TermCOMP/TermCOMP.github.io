(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

perm_in_2: (b,f)

insert_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   perm_in_ga([], []) -> perm_out_ga([], [])
   perm_in_ga(.(X, L), Z) -> U1_ga(X, L, Z, perm_in_ga(L, Y))
   U1_ga(X, L, Z, perm_out_ga(L, Y)) -> U2_ga(X, L, Z, insert_in_gga(X, Y, Z))
   insert_in_gga(X, [], .(X, [])) -> insert_out_gga(X, [], .(X, []))
   insert_in_gga(X, L, .(X, L)) -> insert_out_gga(X, L, .(X, L))
   insert_in_gga(X, .(H, L1), .(H, L2)) -> U3_gga(X, H, L1, L2, insert_in_gga(X, L1, L2))
   U3_gga(X, H, L1, L2, insert_out_gga(X, L1, L2)) -> insert_out_gga(X, .(H, L1), .(H, L2))
   U2_ga(X, L, Z, insert_out_gga(X, Y, Z)) -> perm_out_ga(.(X, L), Z)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
perm_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  perm_in_ga(x1)

[]  =  []

perm_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  perm_out_ga(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_ga(x1, x2, x4)

U2_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U2_ga(x1, x2, x4)

insert_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  insert_in_gga(x1, x2)

insert_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  insert_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)

U3_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U3_gga(x1, x2, x3, x5)

----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

append_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   append_in_gga(.(H, X), Y, .(X, Z)) -> U1_gga(H, X, Y, Z, append_in_gga(X, Y, Z))
   append_in_gga([], Y, Y) -> append_out_gga([], Y, Y)
   U1_gga(H, X, Y, Z, append_out_gga(X, Y, Z)) -> append_out_gga(.(H, X), Y, .(X, Z))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
append_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  append_in_gga(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x5)

[]  =  []

append_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  append_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)

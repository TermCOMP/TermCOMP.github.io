----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

len_in_2: (b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   len_in_ga([], 0) -> len_out_ga([], 0)
   len_in_ga(.(X1, Ts), s(N)) -> U1_ga(X1, Ts, N, len_in_ga(Ts, N))
   U1_ga(X1, Ts, N, len_out_ga(Ts, N)) -> len_out_ga(.(X1, Ts), s(N))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
len_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  len_in_ga(x1)

[]  =  []

len_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  len_out_ga(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_ga(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_ga(x1, x2, x4)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

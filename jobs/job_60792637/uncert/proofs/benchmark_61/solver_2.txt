We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

qs_in_2: (b,f)

part_in_4: (b,b,f,f)

less_in_2: (b,b)

app_in_3: (b,b,f)

(26) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*PART_IN_GGAA(X, .(Y, Xs)) -> U5_GGAA(X, Y, Xs, less_in_gg(X, Y))
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2, 2 > 3


*PART_IN_GGAA(X, .(Y, Xs)) -> PART_IN_GGAA(X, Xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*U5_GGAA(X, Y, Xs, less_out_gg) -> PART_IN_GGAA(X, Xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 3 >= 2

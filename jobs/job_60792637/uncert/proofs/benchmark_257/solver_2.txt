Query: select(g,g,a)
----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

select_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   select_in_gga(X, .(X, Xs), Xs) -> select_out_gga(X, .(X, Xs), Xs)
   select_in_gga(X, .(Y, Xs), .(Y, Zs)) -> U1_gga(X, Y, Xs, Zs, select_in_gga(X, Xs, Zs))
   U1_gga(X, Y, Xs, Zs, select_out_gga(X, Xs, Zs)) -> select_out_gga(X, .(Y, Xs), .(Y, Zs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
select_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  select_in_gga(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

select_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  select_out_gga(x3)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gga(x2, x5)





Infinitary Constructor Rewriting Termination of PiTRS implies Termination of Prolog

   U1_gga(X, Y, Xs, Zs, select_out_gga(X, Xs, Zs)) -> select_out_gga(X, .(Y, Xs), .(Y, Zs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
select_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  select_in_gga(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LOPSTR] we result in the following initial DP problem:

   U1_gga(X, Y, Xs, Zs, select_out_gga(X, Xs, Zs)) -> select_out_gga(X, .(Y, Xs), .(Y, Zs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
select_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  select_in_gga(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

select_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  select_out_gga(x3)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gga(x2, x5)

SELECT_IN_GGA(x1, x2, x3)  =  SELECT_IN_GGA(x1, x2)

U1_GGA(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_GGA(x2, x5)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

select_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  select_out_gga(x3)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gga(x2, x5)

(11) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*SELECT_IN_GGA(X, .(Y, Xs)) -> SELECT_IN_GGA(X, Xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2

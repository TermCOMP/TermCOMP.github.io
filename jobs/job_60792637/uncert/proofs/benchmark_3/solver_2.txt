Query: app(a,a,g)
----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

app_in_3: (f,f,b)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app_in_aag([], X, X) -> app_out_aag([], X, X)
   app_in_aag(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs)) -> U1_aag(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_in_aag(Xs, Ys, Zs))
   U1_aag(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_out_aag(Xs, Ys, Zs)) -> app_out_aag(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
app_in_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_in_aag(x3)

app_out_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_out_aag(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_aag(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_aag(x1, x5)





Infinitary Constructor Rewriting Termination of PiTRS implies Termination of Prolog

   U1_aag(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_out_aag(Xs, Ys, Zs)) -> app_out_aag(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
app_in_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_in_aag(x3)

app_out_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_out_aag(x1, x2)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_aag(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_aag(x1, x5)

APP_IN_AAG(x1, x2, x3)  =  APP_IN_AAG(x3)

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP_IN_AAG(.(X, Zs)) -> APP_IN_AAG(Zs)

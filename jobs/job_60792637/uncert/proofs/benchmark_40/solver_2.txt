(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

max_in_3: (f,b,f)

less_in_2: (b,f) (f,b)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   max_in_aga(X, Y, X) -> U1_aga(X, Y, less_in_ga(Y, X))
   less_in_ga(0, s(X1)) -> less_out_ga(0, s(X1))
   less_in_ga(s(X), s(Y)) -> U3_ga(X, Y, less_in_ga(X, Y))
   U3_ga(X, Y, less_out_ga(X, Y)) -> less_out_ga(s(X), s(Y))
   U1_aga(X, Y, less_out_ga(Y, X)) -> max_out_aga(X, Y, X)
   max_in_aga(X, Y, Y) -> U2_aga(X, Y, less_in_ag(X, s(Y)))

   less_in_ag(s(X), s(Y)) -> U3_ag(X, Y, less_in_ag(X, Y))
   U3_ag(X, Y, less_out_ag(X, Y)) -> less_out_ag(s(X), s(Y))
   U2_aga(X, Y, less_out_ag(X, s(Y))) -> max_out_aga(X, Y, Y)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
max_in_aga(x1, x2, x3)  =  max_in_aga(x2)

U1_aga(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_aga(x3)

less_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ga(x1)

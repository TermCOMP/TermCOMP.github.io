(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

in_order_in_2: (b,f)

app_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   in_order_in_ga(void, []) -> in_order_out_ga(void, [])
   in_order_in_ga(tree(X, Left, Right), Xs) -> U1_ga(X, Left, Right, Xs, in_order_in_ga(Left, Ls))

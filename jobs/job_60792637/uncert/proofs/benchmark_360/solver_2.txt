----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

app_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app_in_gga([], X, X) -> app_out_gga([], X, X)
   app_in_gga(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs)) -> U1_gga(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_in_gga(Xs, Ys, Zs))
   U1_gga(X, Xs, Ys, Zs, app_out_gga(Xs, Ys, Zs)) -> app_out_gga(.(X, Xs), Ys, .(X, Zs))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
app_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_in_gga(x1, x2)

[]  =  []

app_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  app_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U1_gga(x1, x2, x3, x5)

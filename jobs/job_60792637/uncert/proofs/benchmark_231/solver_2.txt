(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

rev_in_2: (b,f)

rev1_in_3: (b,b,f)

rev2_in_3: (b,b,f)

(17) QDPQMonotonicMRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the Q-monotonic rule removal processor with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented such that it always occurs at a strongly monotonic position in a (P,Q,R)-chain.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   U1_GA(X, XS, rev1_out_gga(Y)) -> REV2_IN_GGA(X, XS)
   REV2_IN_GGA(X, .(Y, YS)) -> U4_GGA(X, rev2_in_gga(Y, YS))

   U4_GGA(X, rev2_out_gga(US)) -> REV_IN_GA(US)
   REV2_IN_GGA(X, .(Y, YS)) -> REV2_IN_GGA(Y, YS)

   POL(.(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_2

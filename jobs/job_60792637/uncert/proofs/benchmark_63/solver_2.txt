(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

reverse_in_2: (b,f)

reverse_in_3: (b,b,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   reverse_in_ga(X1s, X2s) -> U1_ga(X1s, X2s, reverse_in_gga(X1s, [], X2s))
   reverse_in_gga([], Xs, Xs) -> reverse_out_gga([], Xs, Xs)
   reverse_in_gga(.(X, X1s), X2s, Ys) -> U2_gga(X, X1s, X2s, Ys, reverse_in_gga(X1s, .(X, X2s), Ys))
   U2_gga(X, X1s, X2s, Ys, reverse_out_gga(X1s, .(X, X2s), Ys)) -> reverse_out_gga(.(X, X1s), X2s, Ys)
   U1_ga(X1s, X2s, reverse_out_gga(X1s, [], X2s)) -> reverse_out_ga(X1s, X2s)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
reverse_in_ga(x1, x2)  =  reverse_in_ga(x1)

U1_ga(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_ga(x3)

reverse_in_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  reverse_in_gga(x1, x2)

[]  =  []

reverse_out_gga(x1, x2, x3)  =  reverse_out_gga(x3)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U2_gga(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U2_gga(x5)

reverse_out_ga(x1, x2)  =  reverse_out_ga(x2)

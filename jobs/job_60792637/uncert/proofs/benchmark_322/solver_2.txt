Query: append3(a,a,g)
----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

append3_in_3: (f,f,b)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   append3_in_aag([], X, X) -> append3_out_aag([], X, X)
   append3_in_aag(.(X, Y), U, .(X, Z)) -> U3_aag(X, Y, U, Z, append3_in_aag(Y, U, Z))
   U3_aag(X, Y, U, Z, append3_out_aag(Y, U, Z)) -> append3_out_aag(.(X, Y), U, .(X, Z))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
append3_in_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  append3_in_aag(x3)

append3_out_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  append3_out_aag(x1, x2, x3)

.(x1, x2)  =  .(x1, x2)

U3_aag(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)  =  U3_aag(x1, x4, x5)

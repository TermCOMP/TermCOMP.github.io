(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

goal_in_1: (b)

s2l_in_2: (b,f)

append_in_3: (b,f,f)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   goal_in_g(X) -> U3_g(X, s2l_in_ga(X, XS))
   s2l_in_ga(s(X), .(Y, Xs)) -> U2_ga(X, Y, Xs, s2l_in_ga(X, Xs))
   s2l_in_ga(0, []) -> s2l_out_ga(0, [])

   U4_g(X, append_out_gaa(XS, YS, ZS)) -> goal_out_g(X)

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
goal_in_g(x1)  =  goal_in_g(x1)

----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

sum_in_3: (f,f,b)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   sum_in_aag(X, 0, X) -> sum_out_aag(X, 0, X)
   sum_in_aag(X, s(Y), s(Z)) -> U1_aag(X, Y, Z, sum_in_aag(X, Y, Z))
   U1_aag(X, Y, Z, sum_out_aag(X, Y, Z)) -> sum_out_aag(X, s(Y), s(Z))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
sum_in_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  sum_in_aag(x3)

sum_out_aag(x1, x2, x3)  =  sum_out_aag(x1, x2, x3)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_aag(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_aag(x3, x4)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

U1_aag(x1, x2, x3, x4)  =  U1_aag(x3, x4)

SUM_IN_AAG(x1, x2, x3)  =  SUM_IN_AAG(x3)

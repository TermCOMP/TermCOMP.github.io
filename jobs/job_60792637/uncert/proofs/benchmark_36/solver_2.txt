Query: less(a,g)
----------------------------------------

(1) PrologToPiTRSProof (SOUND)
We use the technique of [TOCL09]. With regard to the inferred argument filtering the predicates were used in the following modes:

less_in_2: (f,b)

Transforming Prolog into the following Term Rewriting System:

Pi-finite rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   less_in_ag(0, s(X1)) -> less_out_ag(0, s(X1))
   less_in_ag(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ag(X, Y, less_in_ag(X, Y))
   U1_ag(X, Y, less_out_ag(X, Y)) -> less_out_ag(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ag(x2)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

less_out_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ag(x1)

U1_ag(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_ag(x3)





Infinitary Constructor Rewriting Termination of PiTRS implies Termination of Prolog

   less_in_ag(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ag(X, Y, less_in_ag(X, Y))
   U1_ag(X, Y, less_out_ag(X, Y)) -> less_out_ag(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ag(x2)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

less_out_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ag(x1)

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LOPSTR] we result in the following initial DP problem:
Pi DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   LESS_IN_AG(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_AG(X, Y, less_in_ag(X, Y))
   LESS_IN_AG(s(X), s(Y)) -> LESS_IN_AG(X, Y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   less_in_ag(0, s(X1)) -> less_out_ag(0, s(X1))
   less_in_ag(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ag(X, Y, less_in_ag(X, Y))
   U1_ag(X, Y, less_out_ag(X, Y)) -> less_out_ag(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ag(x2)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

less_out_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ag(x1)

U1_ag(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_ag(x3)

LESS_IN_AG(x1, x2)  =  LESS_IN_AG(x2)

U1_AG(x1, x2, x3)  =  U1_AG(x3)

   less_in_ag(s(X), s(Y)) -> U1_ag(X, Y, less_in_ag(X, Y))
   U1_ag(X, Y, less_out_ag(X, Y)) -> less_out_ag(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ag(x2)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

less_out_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ag(x1)

   U1_ag(X, Y, less_out_ag(X, Y)) -> less_out_ag(s(X), s(Y))

The argument filtering Pi contains the following mapping:
less_in_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_in_ag(x2)

less_out_ag(x1, x2)  =  less_out_ag(x1)

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*LESS_IN_AG(s(Y)) -> LESS_IN_AG(Y)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

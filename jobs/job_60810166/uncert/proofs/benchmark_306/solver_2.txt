Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [eval_foo_bb1_in/3]
1. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_stop/1]
2. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_bb2_in/1]
3. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_bb1_in_loop_cont/2]
4. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_bb0_in/1]
5. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_start/4]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_bb1_in/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
4. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_bb0_in/1
5. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_start/4

Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of eval_foo_bb1_in(V__01,V__0,B):
* Chain [[5]]...: 1*it(5)+0
  with precondition: [V__0>=13,17>=V__0,V__0+V__01=30,B=2] 


#### Cost of chains of eval_foo_bb0_in(B):
* Chain [6]...: 1*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [] 


#### Cost of chains of eval_foo_start(V_bob,V_samantha,V_temp,B):
* Chain [7]...: 1*s(2)+0

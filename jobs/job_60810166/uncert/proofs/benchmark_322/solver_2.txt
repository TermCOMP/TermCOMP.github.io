WORST_CASE(?,O(1))  

Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_stop/1]
1. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations eval_foo_start/1 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [2] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of eval_foo_start/1 
* CEs [2] --> Loop 2 

### Ranking functions of CR eval_foo_start(B) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR eval_foo_start(B) 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of eval_foo_start(B):
* Chain [2]: 0
  with precondition: [] 


Closed-form bounds of eval_foo_start(B): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [2] with precondition: [] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of eval_foo_start(B): 0 
Asymptotic class: constant 
* Total analysis performed in 1 ms.

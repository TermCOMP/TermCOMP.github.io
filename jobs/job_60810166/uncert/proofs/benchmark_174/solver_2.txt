Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [eval_foo_bb1_in/1]
1. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_bb0_in/1]
2. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_bb1_in/1
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations eval_foo_bb1_in/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [3] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of eval_foo_bb1_in/1 
* CEs [3] --> Loop 3 

### Ranking functions of CR eval_foo_bb1_in(B) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR eval_foo_bb1_in(B) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Specialization of cost equations eval_foo_start/2 
* CE 1 is refined into CE [4] 


### Cost equations --> "Loop" of eval_foo_start/2 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

### Ranking functions of CR eval_foo_start(V_x,B)

Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of eval_foo_bb1_in(B):
* Chain [[3]]...: 1*it(3)+0
  with precondition: [] 


#### Cost of chains of eval_foo_start(V_x,B):
* Chain [4]...: 1*s(1)+0
  with precondition: []

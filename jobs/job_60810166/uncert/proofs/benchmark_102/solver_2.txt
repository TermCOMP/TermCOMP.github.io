Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [eval_foo_bb1_in/3,eval_foo_bb2_in/3]
1. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_stop/1]
2. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_bb3_in/1]
3. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_bb1_in_loop_cont/2]
4. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_bb0_in/1]
5. non_recursive  : [eval_foo_start/5]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_bb1_in/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
4. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_bb0_in/1
5. SCC is partially evaluated into eval_foo_start/5

Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y)
(RULES
b -> f(a)
f(x) -> x | g(x) ->* c(y)
g(a) -> c(b)
)


Problem 1: 
Valid CTRS Processor:
-> Rules:
 b -> f(a)
 f(x) -> x | g(x) ->* c(y)
 g(a) -> c(b)
-> The system is a 2-CTRS.

Problem 1: 

Underlying TRS Transformation Processor:
-> Rules:
 b -> f(a)
 f(x) -> x | g(x) ->* c(y)
 g(a) -> c(b)
-> New Rules:
 b -> f(a)
 f(x) -> x
 g(a) -> c(b)

Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y)
(RULES
b -> f(a)
f(x) -> x
g(a) -> c(b)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 b -> f(a)
 f(x) -> x
 g(a) -> c(b)
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 B -> F(a)
 G(a) -> B
-> Rules:
 b -> f(a)
 f(x) -> x
 g(a) -> c(b)

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 B -> F(a)
 G(a) -> B
-> Rules:
 b -> f(a)
 f(x) -> x
 g(a) -> c(b)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

YES
We consider the system ExVq5.

  Alphabet:

    cons : [a * alist] --> alist 
    map : [a -> a * alist] --> alist 
    nil : [] --> alist 
    o : [a -> a * a -> a * a] --> a 

  Rules:

    map(F, nil) => nil 
    map(F, cons(X, Y)) => cons(F X, map(F, Y)) 
    map(F, map(G, X)) => map(/\x.o(F, G, x), X) 
    o(F, G, X) => F (G X) 

We use the dependency pair framework as described in [Kop12, Ch. 6/7], with static dependency pairs (see [KusIsoSakBla09] and the adaptation for AFSMs and accessible arguments in [FuhKop19]).

We thus obtain the following dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, computable, formative):

  Dependency Pairs P_0:

    0] map#(F, cons(X, Y)) =#> map#(F, Y)   
    1] map#(F, map(G, X)) =#> map#(/\x.o(F, G, x), X)   
    2] map#(F, map(G, X)) =#> o#(F, G, Y)   

  Rules R_0:

    map(F, nil) => nil 
    map(F, cons(X, Y)) => cons(F X, map(F, Y)) 
    map(F, map(G, X)) => map(/\x.o(F, G, x), X) 
    o(F, G, X) => F (G X) 

Thus, the original system is terminating if (P_0, R_0, computable, formative) is finite.

We consider the dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, computable, formative).

We place the elements of P in a dependency graph approximation G (see e.g. [Kop12, Thm. 7.27, 7.29], as follows:

    * 0 : 0, 1, 2 
    * 1 : 0, 1, 2 
    * 2 :  

This graph has the following strongly connected components:

  P_1:

    map#(F, cons(X, Y)) =#> map#(F, Y)   
    map#(F, map(G, X)) =#> map#(/\x.o(F, G, x), X)   

By [Kop12, Thm. 7.31], we may replace any dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, m, f) by (P_1, R_0, m, f).

Thus, the original system is terminating if (P_1, R_0, computable, formative) is finite.

We consider the dependency pair problem (P_1, R_0, computable, formative).

We apply the subterm criterion with the following projection function:

  nu(map#) = 2 

Thus, we can orient the dependency pairs as follows:

  nu(map#(F, cons(X, Y))) = cons(X, Y) |> Y = nu(map#(F, Y)) 
  nu(map#(F, map(G, X))) = map(G, X) |> X = nu(map#(/\x.o(F, G, x), X)) 

By [FuhKop19, Thm. 61], we may replace a dependency pair problem (P_1, R_0, computable, f) by ({}, R_0, computable, f).  By the empty set processor [Kop12, Thm. 7.15] this problem may be immediately removed.

As all dependency pair problems were succesfully simplified with sound (and complete) processors until nothing remained, we conclude termination.

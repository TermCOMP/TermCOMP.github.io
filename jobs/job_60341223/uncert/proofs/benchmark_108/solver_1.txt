YES
We consider the system uc1rg.

  Alphabet:

    !div : [real * real] --> real 
    !minus : [real] --> real 
    !plus : [real * real] --> real 
    !times : [real * real] --> real 
    One : [] --> real 
    Zero : [] --> real 
    cos : [real] --> real 
    der : [real -> real] --> real -> real 
    ln : [real] --> real 
    sin : [real] --> real 

  Rules:

    der(/\x.X) => /\y.Zero 
    der(/\x.x) => /\y.One 
    der(/\x.sin(x)) => /\y.cos(y) 
    der(/\x.cos(x)) => /\y.!minus(sin(y)) 
    der(/\x.!plus(X[x], Y[x])) => /\y.!plus(der(/\z.X[z]) y, der(/\u.Y[u]) y) 
    der(/\x.!times(X[x], Y[x])) => /\y.!plus(!times(der(/\z.X[z]) y, Y[y]), !times(X[y], der(/\u.Y[u]) y)) 
    der(/\x.ln(X[x])) => /\y.!div(der(/\z.X[z]) y, X[y]) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  der(/\x.X) >? /\y.Zero 
  der(/\x.x) >? /\y.One 
  der(/\x.sin(x)) >? /\y.cos(y) 
  der(/\x.cos(x)) >? /\y.!minus(sin(y)) 
  der(/\x.!plus(X[x], Y[x])) >? /\y.!plus(der(/\z.X[z]) y, der(/\u.Y[u]) y) 
  der(/\x.!times(X[x], Y[x])) >? /\y.!plus(!times(der(/\z.X[z]) y, Y[y]), !times(X[y], der(/\u.Y[u]) y)) 
  der(/\x.ln(X[x])) >? /\y.!div(der(/\z.X[z]) y, X[y]) 

We use a recursive path ordering as defined in [Kop12, Chapter 5].

Argument functions:

  [[One]] = _|_ 
  [[Zero]] = _|_ 

We choose Lex = {} and Mul = {!div, !minus, !plus, !times, @_{o -> o}, cos, der, ln, sin}, and the following precedence: der > @_{o -> o} > cos > sin > ln > !div > !times > !plus > !minus

Taking the argument function into account, and fixing the greater / greater equal choices, the constraints can be denoted as follows:

  der(/\x.X) >= /\x._|_ 
  der(/\x.x) > /\x._|_ 
  der(/\x.sin(x)) > /\x.cos(x) 
  der(/\x.cos(x)) >= /\x.!minus(sin(x)) 
  der(/\x.!plus(X[x], Y[x])) > /\x.!plus(@_{o -> o}(der(/\y.X[y]), x), @_{o -> o}(der(/\z.Y[z]), x)) 
  der(/\x.!times(X[x], Y[x])) >= /\x.!plus(!times(@_{o -> o}(der(/\y.X[y]), x), Y[x]), !times(X[x], @_{o -> o}(der(/\z.Y[z]), x))) 
  der(/\x.ln(X[x])) >= /\x.!div(@_{o -> o}(der(/\y.X[y]), x), X[x])

We use a recursive path ordering as defined in [Kop12, Chapter 5].

We can thus remove the following rules:

  der(/\x.ln(X[x])) => /\y.!div(der(/\z.X[z]) y, X[y]) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  der(/\x.cos(x)) >? /\y.!minus(sin(y)) 
  der(/\x.!times(X[x], Y[x])) >? /\y.!plus(!times(der(/\z.X[z]) y, Y[y]), !times(X[y], der(/\u.Y[u]) y)) 

We use a recursive path ordering as defined in [Kop12, Chapter 5].

We choose Lex = {} and Mul = {!minus, !plus, !times, @_{o -> o}, cos, der, sin}, and the following precedence: der > !plus > !times > @_{o -> o} > cos > !minus > sin

With these choices, we have:

  1] der(/\x.cos(x)) >= /\x.!minus(sin(x))  because [2], by (Star) 
  2] der*(/\x.cos(x)) >= /\x.!minus(sin(x))  because [3], by (Select) 
  3] /\y.cos(y) >= /\y.!minus(sin(y))  because [4], by (Abs) 
  4] cos(x) >= !minus(sin(x))  because [5], by (Star) 
  5] cos*(x) >= !minus(sin(x))  because cos > !minus and [6], by (Copy) 
  6] cos*(x) >= sin(x)  because cos > sin and [7], by (Copy) 
  7] cos*(x) >= x  because [8], by (Select) 
  8] x >= x  by (Var) 

  9] der(/\x.!times(X[x], Y[x])) > /\x.!plus(!times(@_{o -> o}(der(/\y.X[y]), x), Y[x]), !times(X[x], @_{o -> o}(der(/\z.Y[z]), x)))  because [10], by definition 
  10] der*(/\x.!times(X[x], Y[x])) >= /\x.!plus(!times(@_{o -> o}(der(/\z.X[z]), x), Y[x]), !times(X[x], @_{o -> o}(der(/\u.Y[u]), x)))  because [11], by (F-Abs)

  15] /\x.!times(X[x], Y[x]) > /\x.X[x]  because [16], by definition 
  16] /\z.!times*(X[z], Y[z]) >= /\z.X[z]  because [17], by (Abs) 
  17] !times*(X[x], Y[x]) >= X[x]  because [18], by (Select)

  27] der*(/\z.!times(X[z], Y[z]), y) >= X[y]  because [28], by (Select) 
  28] !times(X[der*(/\z.!times(X[z], Y[z]), y)], Y[der*(/\u.!times(X[u], Y[u]), y)]) >= X[y]  because [29], by (Star) 
  29] !times*(X[der*(/\z.!times(X[z], Y[z]), y)], Y[der*(/\u.!times(X[u], Y[u]), y)]) >= X[y]  because [30], by (Select) 
  30] X[der*(/\z.!times(X[z], Y[z]), y)] >= X[y]  because [20], by (Meta) 
  31] der*(/\z.!times(X[z], Y[z]), y) >= @_{o -> o}(der(/\z.Y[z]), y)  because der > @_{o -> o}, [32] and [20], by (Copy) 
  32] der*(/\z.!times(X[z], Y[z]), y) >= der(/\z.Y[z])  because der in Mul and [33], by (Stat) 
  33] /\z.!times(X[z], Y[z]) > /\z.Y[z]  because [34], by definition 
  34] /\u.!times*(X[u], Y[u]) >= /\u.Y[u]  because [35], by (Abs) 
  35] !times*(X[z], Y[z]) >= Y[z]  because [36], by (Select) 
  36] Y[z] >= Y[z]  because [37], by (Meta) 
  37] z >= z  by (Var) 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  der(/\x.!times(X[x], Y[x])) => /\y.!plus(!times(der(/\z.X[z]) y, Y[y]), !times(X[y], der(/\u.Y[u]) y)) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  der(/\x.cos(x)) >? /\y.!minus(sin(y)) 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  !minus = Lam[y0].y0 
  cos = Lam[y0].3 + 3*y0 
  der = Lam[G0;y1].3 + 3*y1 + G0(0) 
  sin = Lam[y0].y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[der(/\x.cos(x))]] = Lam[y0].6 + 3*y0 > Lam[y0].y0 = [[/\x.!minus(sin(x))]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  der(/\x.cos(x)) => /\y.!minus(sin(y)) 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

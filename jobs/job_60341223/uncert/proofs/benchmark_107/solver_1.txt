We consider the system OZ0Vz.

  Alphabet:

    !280 : [N -> N * N] --> N 
    a : [] --> N 
    f : [N] --> N 

  Rules:

    !280(F, a) => f(a) 
    !280(F, X) => F X 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  !280(F, a) >? f(a) 
  !280(F, X) >? F X 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  !280 = Lam[G0;y1].3 + 3*y1 + G0(y1) 
  a = 0 
  f = Lam[y0].y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[!280(_F0, a)]] = 3 + F0(0) > 0 = [[f(a)]] 
  [[!280(_F0, _x1)]] = 3 + 3*x1 + F0(x1) > x1 + F0(x1) = [[_F0 _x1]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  !280(F, a) => f(a) 
  !280(F, X) => F X 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

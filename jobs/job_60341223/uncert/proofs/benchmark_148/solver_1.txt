We consider the system QnK00.

  Alphabet:

    cons : [a * b] --> b 
    iterate : [a -> a * a] --> b 

  Rules:

    iterate(F, X) => cons(X, iterate(F, F X)) 

It is easy to see that this system is non-terminating:

  iterate(f, x) 
    => cons(x, iterate(f, f x)) 
    |> iterate(f, f x) 

That is, a term s reduces to a term t which has a subterm that is an instance of the original term.

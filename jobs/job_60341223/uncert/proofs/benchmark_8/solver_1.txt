We consider the system cXAHI.

  Alphabet:

    c : [(C -> L) -> L] --> C 
    d : [] --> C 
    ex : [] --> C -> L 
    nil : [] --> L 

  Rules:

    ex d => nil 
    ex c(F) => F ex 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  ex d >? nil 
  ex c(F) >? F ex 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  c = Lam[G0].3 + G0(Lam[y1].0) 
  d = 3 
  ex = Lam[y0].0 
  nil = 0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[ex d]] = 3 > 0 = [[nil]] 
  [[ex c(_F0)]] = 3 + F0(Lam[y0].0) > F0(Lam[y0].0) = [[_F0 ex]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  ex d => nil 
  ex c(F) => F ex 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

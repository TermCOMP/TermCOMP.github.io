We consider the system 1HKrA.

  Alphabet:

    app : [arrab * a] --> b 
    lam : [a -> b] --> arrab 

  Rules:

    app(lam(F), X) => F X 
    lam(/\x.app(X, x)) => X 

We use the dependency pair framework as described in [Kop12, Ch. 6/7], with static dependency pairs (see [KusIsoSakBla09] and the adaptation for AFSMs and accessible arguments in [FuhKop19]).

We thus obtain the following dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, computable, all):

  Dependency Pairs P_0:


  Rules R_0:

    app(lam(F), X) => F X 
    lam(/\x.app(X, x)) => X 

Thus, the original system is terminating if (P_0, R_0, computable, all) is finite.

We consider the dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, computable, all).

We place the elements of P in a dependency graph approximation G (see e.g. [Kop12, Thm. 7.27, 7.29], as follows:


This graph has no strongly connected components.  By [Kop12, Thm. 7.31], this implies finiteness of the dependency pair problem.

As all dependency pair problems were succesfully simplified with sound (and complete) processors until nothing remained, we conclude termination.

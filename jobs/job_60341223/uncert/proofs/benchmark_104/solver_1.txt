We consider the system I9muA.

  Alphabet:

    !280 : [nat -> nat * nat] --> nat 
    f : [nat * nat] --> nat 
    g : [nat -> nat] --> nat 

  Rules:

    f(g(/\x.f(x, x)), g(/\y.f(y, y))) => !280(/\z.f(z, z), g(/\u.f(u, u))) 
    !280(/\x.X[x], Y) => X[Y] 

It is easy to see that this system is non-terminating:

  f(g(/\x.f(x, x)), g(/\y.f(y, y))) 
    => !280(/\x.f(x, x), g(/\y.f(y, y))) 
    => f(g(/\x.f(x, x)), g(/\y.f(y, y))) 

That is, a term s reduces to a term t which instantiates s.

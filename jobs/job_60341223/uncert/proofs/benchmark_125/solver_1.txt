We consider the system ymaVT.

  Alphabet:

    f : [N -> N * N] --> N 
    g : [] --> N -> N 
    h : [N] --> N 

  Rules:

    f(g, X) => h(X) 
    f(F, X) => F X 
    h(X) => f(/\x.x, X) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  f(g, X) >? h(X) 
  f(F, X) >? F X 
  h(X) >? f(/\x.x, X) 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  f = Lam[G0;y1].y1 + 2*G0(y1) 
  g = Lam[y0].3 + 3*y0 
  h = Lam[y0].3*y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[f(g, _x0)]] = 6 + 7*x0 > 3*x0 = [[h(_x0)]] 
  [[f(_F0, _x1)]] = x1 + 2*F0(x1) >= x1 + F0(x1) = [[_F0 _x1]] 
  [[h(_x0)]] = 3*x0 >= 3*x0 = [[f(/\x.x, _x0)]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  f(g, X) => h(X) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  f(F, X) >? F X 
  h(X) >? f(/\x.x, X) 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  f = Lam[G0;y1].y1 + G0(y1) 
  h = Lam[y0].3 + 3*y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[f(_F0, _x1)]] = x1 + F0(x1) >= x1 + F0(x1) = [[_F0 _x1]] 
  [[h(_x0)]] = 3 + 3*x0 > 2*x0 = [[f(/\x.x, _x0)]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  h(X) => f(/\x.x, X) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  f(F, X) >? F X 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  f = Lam[G0;y1].1 + y1 + G0(y1) 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[f(_F0, _x1)]] = 1 + x1 + F0(x1) > x1 + F0(x1) = [[_F0 _x1]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  f(F, X) => F X 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

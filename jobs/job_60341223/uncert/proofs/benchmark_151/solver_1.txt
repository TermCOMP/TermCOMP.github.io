We consider the system vRTra.

  Alphabet:

    O : [] --> b 
    cons : [a * b] --> b 
    nil : [] --> b 
    plus : [b * b] --> b 
    s : [b] --> b 
    sumwith : [a -> b * b] --> b 

  Rules:

    plus(O, X) => X 
    plus(s(X), Y) => s(plus(X, Y)) 
    sumwith(F, nil) => nil 
    sumwith(F, cons(X, Y)) => plus(F X, sumwith(F, Y)) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  plus(O, X) >? X 
  plus(s(X), Y) >? s(plus(X, Y)) 
  sumwith(F, nil) >? nil 
  sumwith(F, cons(X, Y)) >? plus(F X, sumwith(F, Y)) 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  O = 3 
  cons = Lam[y0;y1].3 + 3*y0 + 3*y1 
  nil = 0 
  plus = Lam[y0;y1].1 + y0 + y1 
  s = Lam[y0].y0 
  sumwith = Lam[G0;y1].3 + 3*y1 + G0(0) + 2*y1*G0(y1) 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[plus(O, _x0)]] = 4 + x0 > x0 = [[_x0]] 
  [[plus(s(_x0), _x1)]] = 1 + x0 + x1 >= 1 + x0 + x1 = [[s(plus(_x0, _x1))]] 
  [[sumwith(_F0, nil)]] = 3 + F0(0) > 0 = [[nil]] 
  [[sumwith(_F0, cons(_x1, _x2))]] = 12 + 9*x1 + 9*x2 + F0(0) + 6*x1*F0(3 + 3*x1 + 3*x2) + 6*x2*F0(3 + 3*x1 + 3*x2) + 6*F0(3 + 3*x1 + 3*x2) > 4 + x1 + 3*x2 + F0(0) + F0(x1) + 2*x2*F0(x2) = [[plus(_F0 _x1, sumwith(_F0, _x2))]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  plus(O, X) => X 
  sumwith(F, nil) => nil 
  sumwith(F, cons(X, Y)) => plus(F X, sumwith(F, Y)) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  plus(s(X), Y) >? s(plus(X, Y)) 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  plus = Lam[y0;y1].y1 + 3*y0 
  s = Lam[y0].1 + y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[plus(s(_x0), _x1)]] = 3 + x1 + 3*x0 > 1 + x1 + 3*x0 = [[s(plus(_x0, _x1))]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  plus(s(X), Y) => s(plus(X, Y)) 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

We consider the system q7k18.

  Alphabet:

    false : [] --> a 
    if : [a * b * b] --> b 
    true : [] --> a 
    until : [b -> a * b -> b * b] --> b 

  Rules:

    if(true, X, Y) => X 
    if(false, X, Y) => Y 
    until(F, G, X) => if(F X, X, until(F, G, G X)) 

It is easy to see that this system is non-terminating:

  until(f, g, x) 
    => if(f x, x, until(f, g, g x)) 
    |> until(f, g, g x) 

That is, a term s reduces to a term t which has a subterm that is an instance of the original term.

We consider the system 3CIvL.

  Alphabet:

    O : [] --> nat 
    f : [nat] --> nat 
    g : [nat -> nat] --> nat 

  Rules:

    f(O) => g(/\x.O) 
    g(F) => F f(O) 

It is easy to see that this system is non-terminating:

  f(O) 
    => g(/\x.O) 
    => (/\x.O) f(O) 
    |> f(O) 

That is, a term s reduces to a term t which has a subterm that is an instance of the original term.

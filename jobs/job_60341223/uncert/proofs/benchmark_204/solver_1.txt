We consider the system kTPBz.

  Alphabet:

    cons : [e * f] --> f 
    f : [b * c] --> a 
    false : [] --> d 
    filter : [e -> d * f] --> f 
    filter2 : [d * e -> d * e * f] --> f 
    g : [b] --> c 
    map : [e -> e * f] --> f 
    nil : [] --> f 
    one : [] --> b 
    true : [] --> d 
    zero : [] --> b 

  Rules:

    f(X, g(X)) => f(one, g(X)) 
    g(one) => g(zero) 
    map(F, nil) => nil 
    map(F, cons(X, Y)) => cons(F X, map(F, Y)) 
    filter(F, nil) => nil 
    filter(F, cons(X, Y)) => filter2(F X, F, X, Y) 
    filter2(true, F, X, Y) => cons(X, filter(F, Y)) 
    filter2(false, F, X, Y) => filter(F, Y) 

This system is non-terminating, as demonstrated by our external first-order non-termination checker:

 || The following well-typed term is terminating: f(one, g(one))

 || The TRS R consists of the following rules:

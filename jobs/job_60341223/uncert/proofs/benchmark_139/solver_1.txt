We consider the system 8Wnhf.

  Alphabet:

    !2801 : [a -> b -> c * a] --> b -> c 
    !2802 : [b -> c * b] --> c 
    f : [] --> a -> b -> c 
    f1 : [a] --> b -> c 
    f2 : [a * b] --> c 

  Rules:

    !2801(f, X) => f1(X) 
    !2802(f1(X), Y) => f2(X, Y) 
    !2801(F, X) => F X 
    !2802(F, X) => F X 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  !2801(f, X) >? f1(X) 
  !2802(f1(X), Y) >? f2(X, Y) 
  !2801(F, X) >? F X 
  !2802(F, X) >? F X 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  !2801 = Lam[G0;y1;y2].3 + 3*y1 + 3*y2 + G0(y1,y2) 
  !2802 = Lam[G0;y1].3 + 3*y1 + G0(0) + G0(y1) 
  f = Lam[y0;y1].3 + 3*y0 + 3*y1 
  f1 = Lam[y0;y1].y0 
  f2 = Lam[y0;y1].y0 + y1 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[!2801(f, _x0)]] = Lam[y0].6 + 6*y0 + 6*x0 > Lam[y0].x0 = [[f1(_x0)]] 
  [[!2802(f1(_x0), _x1)]] = 3 + 2*x0 + 3*x1 > x0 + x1 = [[f2(_x0, _x1)]] 
  [[!2801(_F0, _x1)]] = Lam[y0].3 + 3*y0 + 3*x1 + F0(x1,y0) > Lam[y0].x1 + F0(x1,y0) = [[_F0 _x1]] 
  [[!2802(_F0, _x1)]] = 3 + 3*x1 + F0(0) + F0(x1) > x1 + F0(x1) = [[_F0 _x1]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  !2801(f, X) => f1(X) 
  !2802(f1(X), Y) => f2(X, Y) 
  !2801(F, X) => F X 
  !2802(F, X) => F X 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

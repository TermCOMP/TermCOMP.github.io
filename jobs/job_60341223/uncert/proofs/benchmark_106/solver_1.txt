We consider the system E8KuM.

  Alphabet:

    !2801 : [a -> b -> c * a] --> b -> c 
    !2802 : [b -> c * b] --> c 
    f : [] --> a -> b -> c 
    f1 : [a] --> b -> c 
    f2 : [a * b] --> c 

  Rules:

    f1(X) => !2801(f, X) 
    f2(X, Y) => !2802(f1(X), Y) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  f1(X) >? !2801(f, X) 
  f2(X, Y) >? !2802(f1(X), Y) 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  !2801 = Lam[G0;y1;y2].y1 + G0(0,0) 
  !2802 = Lam[G0;y1].y1 + G0(0) 
  f = Lam[y0;y1].0 
  f1 = Lam[y0;y1].1 + y0 
  f2 = Lam[y0;y1].3 + 3*y0 + 3*y1 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[f1(_x0)]] = Lam[y0].1 + x0 > Lam[y0].x0 = [[!2801(f, _x0)]] 
  [[f2(_x0, _x1)]] = 3 + 3*x0 + 3*x1 > 1 + x0 + x1 = [[!2802(f1(_x0), _x1)]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  f1(X) => !2801(f, X) 
  f2(X, Y) => !2802(f1(X), Y) 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

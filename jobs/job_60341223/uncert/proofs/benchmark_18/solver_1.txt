We consider the system 7OpLe.

  Alphabet:

    New : [N -> A] --> A 

  Rules:

    New(/\x.X) => X 
    New(/\x.New(/\y.X[x, y])) => New(/\z.New(/\u.X[u, z])) 

It is easy to see that this system is non-terminating:

  New(/\x.New(/\y.f x y)) 
    => New(/\x.New(/\y.f y x)) 
    => New(/\x.New(/\y.f x y)) 

That is, a term s reduces to a term t which instantiates s.

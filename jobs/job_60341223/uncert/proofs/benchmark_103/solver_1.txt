We consider the system Vmof4.

  Alphabet:

    cons : [a -> a * listf] --> listf 
    dapply : [a * a -> a * a -> a] --> a 
    lapply : [a * listf] --> a 
    nil : [] --> listf 

  Rules:

    dapply(X, F, G) => F (G X) 
    lapply(X, nil) => X 
    lapply(X, cons(F, Y)) => F lapply(X, Y) 

We use the dependency pair framework as described in [Kop12, Ch. 6/7], with static dependency pairs (see [KusIsoSakBla09] and the adaptation for AFSMs and accessible arguments in [FuhKop19]).

We thus obtain the following dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, computable, formative):

  Dependency Pairs P_0:

    0] lapply#(X, cons(F, Y)) =#> lapply#(X, Y)   

  Rules R_0:

    dapply(X, F, G) => F (G X) 
    lapply(X, nil) => X 
    lapply(X, cons(F, Y)) => F lapply(X, Y) 

Thus, the original system is terminating if (P_0, R_0, computable, formative) is finite.

We consider the dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, computable, formative).

We apply the subterm criterion with the following projection function:

  nu(lapply#) = 2 

Thus, we can orient the dependency pairs as follows:

  nu(lapply#(X, cons(F, Y))) = cons(F, Y) |> Y = nu(lapply#(X, Y)) 

By [FuhKop19, Thm. 61], we may replace a dependency pair problem (P_0, R_0, computable, f) by ({}, R_0, computable, f).  By the empty set processor [Kop12, Thm. 7.15] this problem may be immediately removed.

As all dependency pair problems were succesfully simplified with sound (and complete) processors until nothing remained, we conclude termination.

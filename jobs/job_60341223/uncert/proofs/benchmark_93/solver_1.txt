We consider the system EqkNP.

  Alphabet:

    !280 : [nat -> nat * nat] --> nat 
    pair : [nat -> nat * nat] --> nat 
    split : [nat] --> nat 

  Rules:

    split(!280(F, X)) => pair(F, X) 
    !280(F, X) => F X 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  split(!280(F, X)) >? pair(F, X) 
  !280(F, X) >? F X 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  !280 = Lam[G0;y1].3 + 3*y1 + 3*G0(0) + 3*G0(y1) 
  pair = Lam[G0;y1].y1 + G0(0) 
  split = Lam[y0].3 + 3*y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[split(!280(_F0, _x1))]] = 12 + 9*x1 + 9*F0(0) + 9*F0(x1) > x1 + F0(0) = [[pair(_F0, _x1)]] 
  [[!280(_F0, _x1)]] = 3 + 3*x1 + 3*F0(0) + 3*F0(x1) > x1 + F0(x1) = [[_F0 _x1]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  split(!280(F, X)) => pair(F, X) 
  !280(F, X) => F X 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

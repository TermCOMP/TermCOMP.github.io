We consider the system jK003.

  Alphabet:

    fapp : [o * o] --> o 
    lam : [o -> o] --> o 

  Rules:

    fapp(lam(F), X) => F X 

This system is non-terminating, as demonstrated by the following reduction:

  fapp(lam(/\x.fapp(x, x)), lam(/\y.fapp(y, y))) 
    => (/\x.fapp(x, x)) lam(/\y.fapp(y, y)) 
    =>_beta fapp(lam(/\x.fapp(x, x)), lam(/\y.fapp(y, y))) 

That is, a term reduces to itself.

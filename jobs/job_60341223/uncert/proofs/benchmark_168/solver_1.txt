We consider the system Rk502.

  Alphabet:

    O : [] --> a 
    id : [] --> a -> a 
    plus : [a] --> a -> a 
    s : [a] --> a 

  Rules:

    id X => X 
    plus(O) => id 
    plus(s(X)) Y => s(plus(X) Y) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  id X >? X 
  plus(O) >? id 
  plus(s(X)) Y >? s(plus(X) Y) 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  O = 3 
  id = Lam[y0].3*y0 
  plus = Lam[y0;y1].3 + 3*y0 + 3*y1 
  s = Lam[y0].3 + y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[id _x0]] = 4*x0 >= x0 = [[_x0]] 
  [[plus(O)]] = Lam[y0].12 + 3*y0 > Lam[y0].3*y0 = [[id]] 
  [[plus(s(_x0)) _x1]] = 12 + 3*x0 + 4*x1 > 6 + 3*x0 + 4*x1 = [[s(plus(_x0) _x1)]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  plus(O) => id 
  plus(s(X)) Y => s(plus(X) Y) 

We use rule removal, following [Kop12, Theorem 2.23].

This gives the following requirements (possibly using Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 in [Kop12]):

  id(X) >? X 

We orient these requirements with a polynomial interpretation in the natural numbers.

The following interpretation satisfies the requirements:

  id = Lam[y0].1 + y0 

Using this interpretation, the requirements translate to:

  [[id(_x0)]] = 1 + x0 > x0 = [[_x0]] 

We can thus remove the following rules:

  id(X) => X 

All rules were succesfully removed.  Thus, termination of the original system has been reduced to termination of the beta-rule, which is well-known to hold.

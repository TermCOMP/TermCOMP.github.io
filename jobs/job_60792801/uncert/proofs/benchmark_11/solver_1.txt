Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(1) -> f(g(1))
   f(f(x)) -> f(x)
   g(0) -> g(f(0))
   g(g(x)) -> g(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(f(x0))
   f(1)
   g(g(x0))
   g(0)


----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(1) -> f(g(1))
   f(f(x)) -> f(x)
   g(0) -> g(f(0))
   g(g(x)) -> g(x)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled f_1(0), g_1(0), f_1(1), g_1(1)* 1 to 7 labelled g_1(0)* 1 to 13 labelled f_1(1)* 1 to 15 labelled g_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled g_1(0)* 6 to 2 labelled 1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled f_1(0)* 8 to 2 labelled 0(0)* 13 to 14 labelled g_1(1)* 14 to 2 labelled 1(1)* 15 to 16 labelled f_1(1)* 16 to 2 labelled 0(1)

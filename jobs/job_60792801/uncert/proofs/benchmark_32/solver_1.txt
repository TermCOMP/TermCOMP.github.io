Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) DependencyPairsProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QDP
(3) DependencyGraphProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) TRUE


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(x, y), x, z) -> f(z, z, z)
   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(x0, x1)


----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(g(x, y), x, z) -> F(z, z, z)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(x, y), x, z) -> f(z, z, z)
   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(x0, x1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(4)
TRUE

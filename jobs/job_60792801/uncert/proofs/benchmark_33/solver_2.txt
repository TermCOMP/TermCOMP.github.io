Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(g(x),x,y) -> F(y,y,g(y))
 F(g(x),x,y) -> G(y)
-> Rules:
 f(g(x),x,y) -> f(y,y,g(y))
 g(g(x)) -> g(x)

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(g(x),x,y) -> F(y,y,g(y))
 F(g(x),x,y) -> G(y)
-> Rules:
 f(g(x),x,y) -> f(y,y,g(y))
 g(g(x)) -> g(x)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

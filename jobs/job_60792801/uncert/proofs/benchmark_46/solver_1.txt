   app(f, 1) -> false
   app(f, app(s, x)) -> app(f, x)
   app(app(app(if, true), x), y) -> x
   app(app(app(if, false), x), y) -> y

   app(app(app(app(filter2, false), fun), x), xs) -> app(app(filter, fun), xs)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   app(f, 0)
   app(app(map, x0), nil)
   app(app(filter, x0), nil)
   app(app(app(app(filter2, false), x0), x1), x2)
   app(app(app(if, true), x0), x1)
   app(f, app(s, x0))
   app(f, 1)
   app(app(g, app(s, x0)), app(s, x1))
   app(app(map, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))
   app(app(filter, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))
   app(app(app(if, false), x0), x1)
   app(app(app(app(filter2, true), x0), x1), x2)
   app(app(g, x0), app(c, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(26) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP(app(filter, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(map, fun), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(filter, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(app(app(filter2, app(fun, x)), fun), x), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 > 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, true), fun), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, fun), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, false), fun), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, fun), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2

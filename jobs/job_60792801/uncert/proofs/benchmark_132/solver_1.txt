Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) YES

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(a)) -> c

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(f(a))


----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 0. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(a)) -> c

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 2 labelled c(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)

(2)
YES

Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO,RATPOLO]:

   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
   APP(app(app(app(filter2, false), f), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(p, 0) -> 0
   app(p, app(s, x)) -> x
   app(app(le, 0), y) -> true
   app(app(le, app(s, x)), 0) -> false
   app(app(le, app(s, x)), app(s, y)) -> app(app(le, x), y)
   app(app(minus, x), y) -> app(app(app(if, app(app(le, x), y)), x), y)
   app(app(app(if, true), x), y) -> 0
   app(app(app(if, false), x), y) -> app(s, app(app(minus, app(p, x)), y))
   app(app(map, f), nil) -> nil
   app(app(map, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> app(app(cons, app(f, x)), app(app(map, f), xs))
   app(app(filter, f), nil) -> nil
   app(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> app(app(app(app(filter2, app(f, x)), f), x), xs)
   app(app(app(app(filter2, true), f), x), xs) -> app(app(cons, x), app(app(filter, f), xs))
   app(app(app(app(filter2, false), f), x), xs) -> app(app(filter, f), xs)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   app(app(app(app(filter2, true), x0), x1), x2)
   app(app(map, x0), nil)
   app(p, 0)
   app(app(filter, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))
   app(app(minus, x0), x1)
   app(app(app(if, true), x0), x1)
   app(p, app(s, x0))
   app(app(le, app(s, x0)), app(s, x1))
   app(app(app(app(filter2, false), x0), x1), x2)
   app(app(le, 0), x0)
   app(app(le, app(s, x0)), 0)
   app(app(app(if, false), x0), x1)
   app(app(map, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))
   app(app(filter, x0), nil)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(26) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(map, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(app(app(filter2, app(f, x)), f), x), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 > 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, true), f), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, false), f), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2

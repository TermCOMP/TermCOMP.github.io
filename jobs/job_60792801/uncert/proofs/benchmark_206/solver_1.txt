Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(c) -> mark(f(g(c)))
   active(f(g(X))) -> mark(g(X))
   proper(c) -> ok(c)
   proper(f(X)) -> f(proper(X))
   proper(g(X)) -> g(proper(X))
   f(ok(X)) -> ok(f(X))
   g(ok(X)) -> ok(g(X))
   top(mark(X)) -> top(proper(X))
   top(ok(X)) -> top(active(X))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   active(f(g(x0)))
   g(ok(x0))
   proper(f(x0))
   active(c)
   f(ok(x0))
   top(ok(x0))
   proper(g(x0))
   top(mark(x0))
   proper(c)

(1) QTRS Reverse (SOUND)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c'(active(x)) -> c'(g(f(mark(x))))
   g(f(active(X))) -> g(mark(X))
   c'(proper(x)) -> c'(ok(x))
   f(proper(X)) -> proper(f(X))
   g(proper(X)) -> proper(g(X))
   ok(f(X)) -> f(ok(X))
   ok(g(X)) -> g(ok(X))
   mark(top(X)) -> proper(top(X))
   ok(top(X)) -> active(top(X))

Q is empty.

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 5. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   c'(active(x)) -> c'(g(f(mark(x))))
   g(f(active(X))) -> g(mark(X))
   c'(proper(x)) -> c'(ok(x))
   f(proper(X)) -> proper(f(X))
   g(proper(X)) -> proper(g(X))
   ok(f(X)) -> f(ok(X))
   ok(g(X)) -> g(ok(X))
   mark(top(X)) -> proper(top(X))
   ok(top(X)) -> active(top(X))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

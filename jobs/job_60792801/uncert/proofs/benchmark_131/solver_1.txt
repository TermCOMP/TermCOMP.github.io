Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(c(f(g(f(a)))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(c(X)) -> active(c(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   c(mark(X)) -> c(X)
   c(active(X)) -> c(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(mark(x0))
   g(active(x0))
   c(active(x0))
   mark(c(x0))
   c(mark(x0))
   mark(a)
   f(mark(x0))
   mark(g(x0))
   f(active(x0))
   active(f(f(a)))
   mark(f(x0))

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(c(f(g(f(a)))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(c(X)) -> active(c(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   c(mark(X)) -> c(X)
   c(active(X)) -> c(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

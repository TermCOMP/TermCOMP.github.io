Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) YES

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(X)) -> f(X)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(g(x0))


----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(g(X)) -> f(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 2 labelled f_1(0), f_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)

(2)
YES

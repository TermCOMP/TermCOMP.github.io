Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   ACTIVE(f(b, X, c)) -> MARK(f(X, c, X))
   MARK(f(z0, c, z0)) -> ACTIVE(f(z0, mark(b), z0))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(c) -> mark(b)
   f(X1, mark(X2), X3) -> f(X1, X2, X3)
   f(mark(X1), X2, X3) -> f(X1, X2, X3)
   f(X1, X2, mark(X3)) -> f(X1, X2, X3)
   f(active(X1), X2, X3) -> f(X1, X2, X3)
   f(X1, active(X2), X3) -> f(X1, X2, X3)
   f(X1, X2, active(X3)) -> f(X1, X2, X3)
   mark(b) -> active(b)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   mark(b)
   mark(c)
   mark(f(x0, x1, x2))
   f(x0, x1, mark(x2))
   f(x0, x1, active(x2))
   f(x0, mark(x1), x2)
   active(c)
   f(mark(x0), x1, x2)
   f(x0, active(x1), x2)
   active(f(b, x0, c))
   f(active(x0), x1, x2)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(25) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

By rewriting [LPAR04] the rule MARK(f(z0, c, z0)) -> ACTIVE(f(z0, mark(b), z0)) at position [0,1] we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (MARK(f(z0, c, z0)) -> ACTIVE(f(z0, active(b), z0)),MARK(f(z0, c, z0)) -> ACTIVE(f(z0, active(b), z0)))

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> f(g(x, y), g(x, y), g(x, y), h(x))
   g(0, 1) -> 0
   g(0, 1) -> 1
   h(g(x, y)) -> h(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, g(x0, x1), x2)
   h(g(x0, x1))
   g(0, 1)


----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> F(g(x, y), g(x, y), g(x, y), h(x))
   F(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> H(x)
   H(g(x, y)) -> H(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> f(g(x, y), g(x, y), g(x, y), h(x))
   g(0, 1) -> 0
   g(0, 1) -> 1
   h(g(x, y)) -> h(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, g(x0, x1), x2)
   h(g(x0, x1))
   g(0, 1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(g(x, y)) -> H(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, g(x, y), z) -> f(g(x, y), g(x, y), g(x, y), h(x))
   g(0, 1) -> 0
   g(0, 1) -> 1
   h(g(x, y)) -> h(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, g(x0, x1), x2)
   h(g(x0, x1))
   g(0, 1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(g(x, y)) -> H(x)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, g(x0, x1), x2)
   h(g(x0, x1))
   g(0, 1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(0, 1, g(x0, x1), x2)
   h(g(x0, x1))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(g(x, y)) -> H(x)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(0, 1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*H(g(x, y)) -> H(x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

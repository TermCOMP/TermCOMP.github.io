Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(a, X, X) -> a__f(X, a__b, b)
   a__b -> a
   mark(f(X1, X2, X3)) -> a__f(X1, mark(X2), X3)
   mark(b) -> a__b
   mark(a) -> a
   a__f(X1, X2, X3) -> f(X1, X2, X3)
   a__b -> b

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   mark(b)
   mark(f(x0, x1, x2))
   a__f(x0, x1, x2)
   mark(a)
   a__b


----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 1
   POL(a__b) = 1
   POL(a__f(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_2 + 2*x_3
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_2 + 2*x_3
   POL(mark(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   mark(f(X1, X2, X3)) -> a__f(X1, mark(X2), X3)
   mark(a) -> a
   a__b -> b

Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:a__b > a

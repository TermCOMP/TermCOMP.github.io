Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(X) -> g(h(f(X)))
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(mark(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> g(X)
   mark(h(X)) -> h(mark(X))
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a__f(x0)
   mark(h(x0))
   mark(g(x0))
   mark(f(x0))


----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (SOUND)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(X) -> f(h(g(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> mark(a__f(X))
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   h(mark(X)) -> mark(h(X))
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a__f(X) -> f(h(g(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> mark(a__f(X))
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   h(mark(X)) -> mark(h(X))
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

Node 11 is start node and node 12 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 11 to 13 labelled f_1(0)* 11 to 15 labelled mark_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled g_1(0), f_1(0), g_1(1)* 11 to 18 labelled mark_1(1)* 12 to 12 labelled #_1(0)* 13 to 14 labelled h_1(0)* 14 to 12 labelled g_1(0), g_1(1)* 15 to 12 labelled a__f_1(0), h_1(0), f_1(1)* 15 to 16 labelled f_1(1)* 15 to 19 labelled mark_1(1)* 15 to 18 labelled mark_1(1)* 16 to 17 labelled h_1(1)* 17 to 12 labelled g_1(1)* 18 to 12 labelled a__f_1(1), f_1(2)* 18 to 20 labelled f_1(2)* 18 to 18 labelled mark_1(1)* 19 to 12 labelled h_1(1)* 19 to 19 labelled mark_1(1)* 20 to 21 labelled h_1(2)* 21 to 12 labelled g_1(2), g_1(1)

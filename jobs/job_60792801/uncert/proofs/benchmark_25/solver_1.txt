Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, c(y)) -> f(x, s(f(y, y)))
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> f(x, s(c(s(y))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, c(x1))
   f(s(x0), s(x1))


----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x, c(y)) -> F(x, s(f(y, y)))
   F(x, c(y)) -> F(y, y)
   F(s(x), s(y)) -> F(x, s(c(s(y))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, c(y)) -> f(x, s(f(y, y)))
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> f(x, s(c(s(y))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, c(x1))
   f(s(x0), s(x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 1 less node.

(6) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)

The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

Subterm Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(s(x),s(y)) -> F(x,s(c(s(y))))
-> Rules:
 f(s(x),s(y)) -> f(x,s(c(s(y))))
 f(x,c(y)) -> f(x,s(f(y,y)))
->Projection:
 pi(F) = 1

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(s(x),s(y)) -> f(x,s(c(s(y))))

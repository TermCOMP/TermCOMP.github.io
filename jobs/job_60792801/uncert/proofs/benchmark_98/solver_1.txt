Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(f(g(f(a))))
   active(g(X)) -> g(active(X))
   g(mark(X)) -> mark(g(X))
   proper(f(X)) -> f(proper(X))
   proper(a) -> ok(a)
   proper(g(X)) -> g(proper(X))
   f(ok(X)) -> ok(f(X))
   g(ok(X)) -> ok(g(X))
   top(mark(X)) -> top(proper(X))
   top(ok(X)) -> top(active(X))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(mark(x0))
   proper(a)
   active(g(x0))
   g(ok(x0))
   proper(f(x0))
   f(ok(x0))
   top(ok(x0))
   proper(g(x0))
   top(mark(x0))
   active(f(f(a)))

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 7. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(f(g(f(a))))
   active(g(X)) -> g(active(X))
   g(mark(X)) -> mark(g(X))
   proper(f(X)) -> f(proper(X))
   proper(a) -> ok(a)
   proper(g(X)) -> g(proper(X))
   f(ok(X)) -> ok(f(X))
   g(ok(X)) -> ok(g(X))
   top(mark(X)) -> top(proper(X))
   top(ok(X)) -> top(active(X))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 51, 52, 66, 68, 69, 71, 77, 83, 84, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 104

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(c) -> mark(f(g(c)))
   active(f(g(X))) -> mark(g(X))
   mark(c) -> active(c)
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(mark(x0))
   g(active(x0))
   mark(c)
   active(f(g(x0)))
   f(mark(x0))
   active(c)
   mark(g(x0))
   f(active(x0))
   mark(f(x0))

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(c) -> mark(f(g(c)))
   active(f(g(X))) -> mark(g(X))
   mark(c) -> active(c)
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 3 labelled mark_1(0), active_1(0), mark_1(1), active_1(1)* 1 to 5 labelled active_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled f_1(0), g_1(0), f_1(1), g_1(1)* 1 to 6 labelled active_1(1)* 1 to 7 labelled mark_1(1)* 1 to 10 labelled active_1(2)* 1 to 11 labelled mark_1(2)* 1 to 12 labelled active_1(3)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled f_1(0)* 3 to 2 labelled g_1(0), g_1(1)* 4 to 5 labelled g_1(0)* 5 to 2 labelled c(0), f_1(0), f_1(1)* 6 to 4 labelled f_1(1)* 6 to 2 labelled g_1(1)* 7 to 8 labelled f_1(1)* 7 to 5 labelled g_1(1)* 8 to 9 labelled g_1(1)* 9 to 2 labelled c(1)* 10 to 2 labelled g_1(2), g_1(1)* 10 to 8 labelled f_1(2)* 10 to 5 labelled g_1(2)* 11 to 9 labelled g_1(2)* 12 to 9 labelled g_1(3)

(1) QTRSToCSRProof (SOUND)
The following Q TRS is given: Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(from(X)) -> mark(cons(X, from(s(X))))
   active(after(0, XS)) -> mark(XS)
   active(after(s(N), cons(X, XS))) -> mark(after(N, XS))
   active(from(X)) -> from(active(X))
   active(cons(X1, X2)) -> cons(active(X1), X2)
   active(s(X)) -> s(active(X))
   active(after(X1, X2)) -> after(active(X1), X2)
   active(after(X1, X2)) -> after(X1, active(X2))
   from(mark(X)) -> mark(from(X))
   cons(mark(X1), X2) -> mark(cons(X1, X2))
   s(mark(X)) -> mark(s(X))
   after(mark(X1), X2) -> mark(after(X1, X2))
   after(X1, mark(X2)) -> mark(after(X1, X2))
   proper(from(X)) -> from(proper(X))
   proper(cons(X1, X2)) -> cons(proper(X1), proper(X2))
   proper(s(X)) -> s(proper(X))
   proper(after(X1, X2)) -> after(proper(X1), proper(X2))
   proper(0) -> ok(0)
   from(ok(X)) -> ok(from(X))
   cons(ok(X1), ok(X2)) -> ok(cons(X1, X2))
   s(ok(X)) -> ok(s(X))
   after(ok(X1), ok(X2)) -> ok(after(X1, X2))
   top(mark(X)) -> top(proper(X))
   top(ok(X)) -> top(active(X))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   active(from(x0))
   active(after(x0, x1))
   after(x0, mark(x1))
   active(cons(x0, x1))
   after(mark(x0), x1)
   from(ok(x0))
   after(ok(x0), ok(x1))
   top(mark(x0))
   active(s(x0))
   s(mark(x0))
   proper(cons(x0, x1))
   proper(after(x0, x1))
   cons(ok(x0), ok(x1))
   cons(mark(x0), x1)
   top(ok(x0))
   proper(from(x0))
   proper(0)
   proper(s(x0))
   s(ok(x0))
   from(mark(x0))

Special symbols used for the transformation (see [GM04]):
top: top_1, active: active_1, mark: mark_1, ok: ok_1, proper: proper_1
The replacement map contains the following entries:

from: {1}
cons: {1}
s: {1}
after: {1, 2}
0: empty set
The QTRS contained just a subset of rules created by the complete Giesl-Middeldorp transformation. Therefore, the inverse transformation is sound, but not necessarily complete.

Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))
   after(0, XS) -> XS

The replacement map contains the following entries:

from: {1}
cons: {1}
s: {1}
after: {1, 2}
0: empty set

----------------------------------------

(5) CSDependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Improved CS-DPs [LPAR08] we result in the following initial Q-CSDP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q-restricted context-sensitive dependency pair problem:
The symbols in {from_1, s_1, after_2, AFTER_2, FROM_1} are replacing on all positions.
For all symbols f in {cons_2} we have mu(f) = {1}.
The symbols in {U_1} are not replacing on any position.

The ordinary context-sensitive dependency pairs DP_o are:
   AFTER(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> AFTER(N, XS)

The collapsing dependency pairs are DP_c:
   AFTER(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> XS


The hidden terms of R are:

   from(s(x0))

Every hiding context is built from:
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@31430ddf
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@298ff247

Hence, the new unhiding pairs DP_u are :
   AFTER(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> U(XS)
   U(s(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(s(x0))) -> FROM(s(x0))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))
   after(0, XS) -> XS
   after(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> after(N, XS)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   from(x0)

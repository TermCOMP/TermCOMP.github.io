We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(26) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(map, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, true), f), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, false), f), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2

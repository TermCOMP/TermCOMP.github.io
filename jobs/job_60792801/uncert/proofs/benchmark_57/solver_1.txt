Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) DependencyPairsProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QDP
(3) DependencyGraphProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) TRUE


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X)) -> f(1, g(X))
   g(1) -> g(0)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, g(x0))
   g(1)


----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(X, g(X)) -> F(1, g(X))
   G(1) -> G(0)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X)) -> f(1, g(X))
   g(1) -> g(0)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, g(x0))
   g(1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
TRUE

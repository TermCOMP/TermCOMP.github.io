Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(X,g(X)) -> F(num1,g(X))
-> Rules:
 f(X,g(X)) -> f(num1,g(X))
 g(num1) -> g(num0)

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(X,g(X)) -> F(num1,g(X))
-> Rules:
 f(X,g(X)) -> f(num1,g(X))
 g(num1) -> g(num0)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

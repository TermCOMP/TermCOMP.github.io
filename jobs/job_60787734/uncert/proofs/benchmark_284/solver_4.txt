Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 ,
  1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 }

Loop of length 15 starting with a source of size 13.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 at position 0 results in
0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 3 results in
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 5 results in
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 7 results in
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 at position 5 results in
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 at position 3 results in
0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 2 results in
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 9 results in

    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 8 results in

    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 7 results in

    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 6 results in

    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 at position 9 results in
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 8 results in

    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 at position 5 results in
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
    Applying rule 1 0 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 0 at position 4 results in

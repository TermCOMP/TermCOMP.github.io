Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208

Node 183 is start node and node 184 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 183 to 185 labelled b_1(0)* 184 to 184 labelled #_1(0)* 185 to 186 labelled a_1(0)* 186 to 187 labelled a_1(0)* 187 to 188 labelled a_1(0)* 188 to 189 labelled b_1(0)* 189 to 190 labelled a_1(0)* 190 to 191 labelled a_1(0)* 191 to 192 labelled b_1(0)* 192 to 193 labelled a_1(0)* 192 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 193 to 194 labelled a_1(0)* 193 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 194 to 195 labelled a_1(0)* 194 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 195 to 196 labelled a_1(0)* 195 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 196 to 184 labelled a_1(0)* 196 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 197 to 198 labelled a_1(1)* 198 to 199 labelled a_1(1)* 199 to 200 labelled a_1(1)* 200 to 201 labelled b_1(1)* 201 to 202 labelled a_1(1)* 202 to 203 labelled a_1(1)* 203 to 204 labelled b_1(1)* 204 to 205 labelled a_1(1)* 204 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 205 to 206 labelled a_1(1)* 205 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 206 to 207 labelled a_1(1)* 206 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 207 to 208 labelled a_1(1)* 207 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 208 to 184 labelled a_1(1)* 208 to 197 labelled b_1(1)

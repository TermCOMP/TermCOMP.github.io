----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0(x1)) -> s(0(x1))
   d(0(x1)) -> 0(x1)
   d(s(x1)) -> s(s(d(x1)))
   f(s(x1)) -> d(f(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(d(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(f(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(0(x1)) -> s(0(x1))




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   d(0(x1)) -> 0(x1)
   d(s(x1)) -> s(s(d(x1)))
   f(s(x1)) -> d(f(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   d(0(x1)) -> 0(x1)
   d(s(x1)) -> s(s(d(x1)))
   f(s(x1)) -> d(f(x1))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   d(0(x0))
   d(s(x0))
   f(s(x0))


----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   D(s(x1)) -> D(x1)
   F(s(x1)) -> D(f(x1))
   F(s(x1)) -> F(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   d(0(x1)) -> 0(x1)
   d(s(x1)) -> s(s(d(x1)))
   f(s(x1)) -> d(f(x1))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   d(0(x0))
   d(s(x0))
   f(s(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 1 less node.

   d(0(x0))
   d(s(x0))
   f(s(x0))

----------------------------------------

(10) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 0 0 0 ,
  1 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 }

  Possible projection steps are implicit:

1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 at position 0 results in
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 0 1 at position 2 results in
1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 0 1 at position 1 results in

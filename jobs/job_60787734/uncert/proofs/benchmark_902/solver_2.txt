Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(x1)) -> b(b(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))
   b(a(x1)) -> b(b(x1))
   b(c(x1)) -> c(a(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

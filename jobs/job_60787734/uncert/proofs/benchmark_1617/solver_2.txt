(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
27, 28, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 58, 60, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76

Node 27 is start node and node 28 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 27 to 41 labelled b_1(0)* 28 to 28 labelled #_1(0)* 41 to 43 labelled a_1(0)* 43 to 45 labelled a_1(0)* 45 to 47 labelled a_1(0)* 47 to 49 labelled b_1(0)* 49 to 51 labelled a_1(0)* 51 to 53 labelled b_1(0)* 53 to 55 labelled a_1(0)* 55 to 57 labelled a_1(0)* 55 to 65 labelled b_1(1)* 57 to 58 labelled a_1(0)* 58 to 60 labelled b_1(0)* 60 to 62 labelled a_1(0)* 60 to 65 labelled b_1(1)* 62 to 28 labelled a_1(0)* 62 to 65 labelled b_1(1)* 65 to 66 labelled a_1(1)* 66 to 67 labelled a_1(1)* 67 to 68 labelled a_1(1)* 68 to 69 labelled b_1(1)* 69 to 70 labelled a_1(1)* 70 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 71 to 72 labelled a_1(1)* 72 to 73 labelled a_1(1)* 72 to 65 labelled b_1(1)* 73 to 74 labelled a_1(1)* 74 to 75 labelled b_1(1)* 75 to 76 labelled a_1(1)* 75 to 65 labelled b_1(1)* 76 to 28 labelled a_1(1)* 76 to 65 labelled b_1(1)

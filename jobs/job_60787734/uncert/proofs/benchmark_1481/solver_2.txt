Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(b(b(a(x1)))) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))
   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))
   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))
   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))
   b(a(b(a(b(x1))))) -> b(b(b(a(a(x1)))))
   a(a(b(a(b(x1))))) -> a(b(b(a(a(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))

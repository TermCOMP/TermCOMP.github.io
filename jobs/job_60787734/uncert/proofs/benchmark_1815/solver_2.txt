Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(b(x1))))) -> a(a(b(b(b(a(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> a(a(b(b(b(a(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> a(a(b(b(b(a(a(x1)))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

Node 1 is start node and node 3 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 3 to 3 labelled #_1(0)* 4 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled b_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled b_1(0)* 6 to 17 labelled a_1(1)* 7 to 8 labelled b_1(0)* 8 to 9 labelled a_1(0)* 9 to 3 labelled a_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled a_1(1)* 18 to 19 labelled b_1(1)* 19 to 20 labelled b_1(1)* 19 to 17 labelled a_1(1)* 20 to 21 labelled b_1(1)* 21 to 22 labelled a_1(1)* 22 to 3 labelled a_1(1)

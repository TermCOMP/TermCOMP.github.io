Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 4 ↦ 1, 3 ↦ 2, 2 ↦ 3, 5 ↦ 4, 6 ↦ 5 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 9-rules system (9 strict rules)
{ 0 0 ⟶ 1 2 ,
  0 3 ⟶ 3 0 ,
  3 3 ⟶ 0 0 0 ,
  2 2 ⟶ 4 5 ,
  2 1 ⟶ 0 0 ,
  1 1 ⟶ 2 ,
  4 4 ⟶ 5 3 ,
  4 5 ⟶ 0 3 ,
  5 5 ⟶ 3 0 }

Removing 6 rules by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜  1 85 ⎟
    ⎜  0  1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜  1 57 ⎟
    ⎜  0  1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

    ⎜   1 113 ⎟
    ⎜   0   1 ⎟
    ⎝         ⎠

    ⎜   1 128 ⎟
    ⎜   0   1 ⎟
    ⎝         ⎠

    ⎜   1 118 ⎟

    ⎜   1 107 ⎟
    ⎜   0   1 ⎟
    ⎝         ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2, 3 ↦ 3 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 0 ⟶ 1 2 ,
  0 3 ⟶ 3 0 ,
  2 1 ⟶ 0 0 }

Removing 2 rules by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 2 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 2 2 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 2 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

3 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 3 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 3:

0 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 1 ⎟

    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)

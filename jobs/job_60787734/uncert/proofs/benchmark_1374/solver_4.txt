Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ ,
  0 1 ⟶ 1 2 ,
  0 2 ⟶ 2 1 0 0 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },

  0 1 ⟶ 2 0 ,
  2 1 ⟶ 1 1 0 2 }

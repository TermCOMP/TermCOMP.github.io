Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))) -> b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))) -> b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70

Node 14 is start node and node 15 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 14 to 16 labelled b_1(0)* 15 to 15 labelled #_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled c_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled b_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled c_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled b_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 24 to 25 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(0)* 25 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 15 labelled a_1(0)* 26 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 60 to 61 labelled c_1(1)* 61 to 62 labelled b_1(1)* 62 to 63 labelled a_1(1)* 63 to 64 labelled a_1(1)* 64 to 65 labelled b_1(1)* 65 to 66 labelled c_1(1)* 66 to 67 labelled b_1(1)* 67 to 68 labelled a_1(1)* 67 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 68 to 69 labelled a_1(1)* 68 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 69 to 70 labelled a_1(1)* 69 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 70 to 15 labelled a_1(1)* 70 to 60 labelled b_1(1)

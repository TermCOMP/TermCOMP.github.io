The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(b(x1))
   c(b(x1)) -> d(x1)
   e(b(x1)) -> c(c(x1))
   d(b(x1)) -> b(f(x1))

   c(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> f(x1)

Q is empty.

Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C(b(x1)) -> D(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 2 0 0 ,
  2 2 ⟶ 1 }

Loop of length 7 starting with a source of size 3.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 1 2
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 2 0 0 at position 0 results in
1 0 0 2 0 0 2
    Applying rule 2 2 ⟶ 1 at position 3 results in
1 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 2 0 0 at position 2 results in
1 0 1 0 0 2 0 0

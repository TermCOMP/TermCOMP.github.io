Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   a(c(x1)) -> x1
   c(b(b(x1))) -> a(a(a(c(c(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

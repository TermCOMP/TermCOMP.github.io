The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(s(x1)) -> x1
   p(0(x1)) -> 0(s(s(p(x1))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   p(0(x0))
   p(s(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(39) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   J(s(x1)) -> F(p(s(p(p(s(x1))))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( F_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1
POL( G_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1
POL( J_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1
POL( s_1(x_1) ) = x_1 + 2
POL( p_1(x_1) ) = max{0, x_1 - 2}
POL( 0_1(x_1) ) = max{0, -2}

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   p(s(x1)) -> x1
   p(0(x1)) -> 0(s(s(p(x1))))

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x1)) -> G(p(s(s(x1))))
   G(s(x1)) -> J(s(p(s(p(s(x1))))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(s(x1)) -> x1
   p(0(x1)) -> 0(s(s(p(x1))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   p(0(x0))
   p(s(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(41) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 2 less nodes.

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> C(x1)
   b(c(x1)) -> A(x1)
   c(a(x1)) -> B(x1)
   A(C(x1)) -> b(x1)
   C(B(x1)) -> a(x1)
   B(A(x1)) -> c(x1)
   a(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A(A(A(x1)))
   A(A(A(A(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B(B(B(x1)))
   B(B(B(B(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))

   C(C(C(C(x1)))) -> c(c(c(c(x1))))

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a(b(x1)) -> C(x1)
   b(c(x1)) -> A(x1)
   c(a(x1)) -> B(x1)
   A(C(x1)) -> b(x1)
   C(B(x1)) -> a(x1)
   B(A(x1)) -> c(x1)
   a(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A(A(A(x1)))
   A(A(A(A(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B(B(B(x1)))
   B(B(B(B(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))
   c(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> C(C(C(x1)))
   C(C(C(C(x1)))) -> c(c(c(c(x1))))
   a(A(x1)) -> x1
   A(a(x1)) -> x1
   b(B(x1)) -> x1
   B(b(x1)) -> x1
   c(C(x1)) -> x1
   C(c(x1)) -> x1

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   B(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> c(A(A(A(x1))))
   A(A(A(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(C(x1)))))
   C(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> a(B(B(B(x1))))

(3) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   B(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> c(A(A(A(x1))))
   A(A(A(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(C(x1)))))
   C(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> a(B(B(B(x1))))
   B(B(B(c(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(A(x1)))))
   A(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> b(C(C(C(x1))))
   C(C(C(a(x1)))) -> c(c(c(c(B(x1)))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   B(a(a(a(a(x0)))))
   A(A(A(b(x0))))
   C(b(b(b(b(x0)))))
   B(B(B(c(x0))))
   A(c(c(c(c(x0)))))
   C(C(C(a(x0))))

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B^1(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A^1(A(A(x1)))
   B^1(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A^1(A(x1))
   B^1(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A^1(x1)
   A^1(A(A(b(x1)))) -> C^1(x1)
   C^1(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B^1(B(B(x1)))
   C^1(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B^1(B(x1))
   C^1(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B^1(x1)
   B^1(B(B(c(x1)))) -> A^1(x1)
   A^1(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> C^1(C(C(x1)))
   A^1(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> C^1(C(x1))
   A^1(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> C^1(x1)
   C^1(C(C(a(x1)))) -> B^1(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   B(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> c(A(A(A(x1))))
   A(A(A(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(C(x1)))))
   C(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> a(B(B(B(x1))))
   B(B(B(c(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(A(x1)))))
   A(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> b(C(C(C(x1))))
   C(C(C(a(x1)))) -> c(c(c(c(B(x1)))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   B(a(a(a(a(x0)))))
   A(A(A(b(x0))))
   C(b(b(b(b(x0)))))
   B(B(B(c(x0))))
   A(c(c(c(c(x0)))))
   C(C(C(a(x0))))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   B^1(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A^1(A(A(x1)))
   B^1(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A^1(A(x1))
   B^1(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> A^1(x1)
   A^1(A(A(b(x1)))) -> C^1(x1)
   C^1(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B^1(B(B(x1)))
   C^1(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B^1(B(x1))
   C^1(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> B^1(x1)
   B^1(B(B(c(x1)))) -> A^1(x1)
   A^1(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> C^1(C(C(x1)))
   A^1(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> C^1(C(x1))
   A^1(c(c(c(c(x1))))) -> C^1(x1)
   C^1(C(C(a(x1)))) -> B^1(x1)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(A^1(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(B^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(C^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 2 + x_1

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))) -> b(b(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))) -> b(b(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160

Node 135 is start node and node 136 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 135 to 137 labelled b_1(0)* 136 to 136 labelled #_1(0)* 137 to 138 labelled b_1(0)* 138 to 139 labelled a_1(0)* 139 to 140 labelled a_1(0)* 140 to 141 labelled b_1(0)* 141 to 142 labelled b_1(0)* 142 to 143 labelled a_1(0)* 143 to 144 labelled b_1(0)* 144 to 145 labelled b_1(0)* 145 to 146 labelled a_1(0)* 145 to 149 labelled b_1(1)* 146 to 147 labelled a_1(0)* 146 to 149 labelled b_1(1)* 147 to 148 labelled a_1(0)* 147 to 149 labelled b_1(1)* 148 to 136 labelled a_1(0)* 148 to 149 labelled b_1(1)* 149 to 150 labelled b_1(1)* 150 to 151 labelled a_1(1)* 151 to 152 labelled a_1(1)* 152 to 153 labelled b_1(1)* 153 to 154 labelled b_1(1)* 154 to 155 labelled a_1(1)* 155 to 156 labelled b_1(1)* 156 to 157 labelled b_1(1)* 157 to 158 labelled a_1(1)* 157 to 149 labelled b_1(1)* 158 to 159 labelled a_1(1)* 158 to 149 labelled b_1(1)* 159 to 160 labelled a_1(1)* 159 to 149 labelled b_1(1)* 160 to 136 labelled a_1(1)* 160 to 149 labelled b_1(1)

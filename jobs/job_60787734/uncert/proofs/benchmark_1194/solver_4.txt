Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 ,
  2 1 ⟶ ,
  2 2 ⟶ 1 }

  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 1 1 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 at position 0 results in
1 2 0 0 1 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 at position 3 results in
1 2 0 1 2 0 0 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 at position 6 results in
1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 at position 5 results in
1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 1
    Applying rule 2 1 ⟶ at position 4 results in
1 2 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 1
    Applying rule 2 2 ⟶ 1 at position 4 results in
1 2 0 1 1 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 at position 6 results in
1 2 0 1 1 0 1 2 0 0
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 at position 5 results in
1 2 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 0 0
    Applying rule 2 2 ⟶ 1 at position 6 results in
1 2 0 1 1 1 1 0 0

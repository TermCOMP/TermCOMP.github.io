Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 11 + x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 8 + x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = 15 + x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = 21 + x_1

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 0(1(3(4(0(5(5(3(0(2(2(4(3(2(3(x1)))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 0(1(3(4(0(5(5(3(0(2(2(4(3(2(3(x1)))))))))))))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   2(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x0))))))))))))


----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   2^1(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 2^1(2(4(3(2(3(x1))))))
   2^1(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 2^1(4(3(2(3(x1)))))
   2^1(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 2^1(3(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 0(1(3(4(0(5(5(3(0(2(2(4(3(2(3(x1)))))))))))))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   2(5(3(3(3(3(5(2(1(4(2(0(x0))))))))))))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(7) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 3 less nodes.

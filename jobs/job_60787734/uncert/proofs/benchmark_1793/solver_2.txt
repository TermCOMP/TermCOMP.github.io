Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(b(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92

Node 2 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 2 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled a_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled a_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled a_1(0)* 8 to 9 labelled b_1(0)* 8 to 37 labelled a_1(1)* 9 to 10 labelled a_1(0)* 10 to 11 labelled b_1(0)* 10 to 21 labelled a_1(1)* 11 to 12 labelled a_1(0)* 12 to 4 labelled b_1(0)* 12 to 21 labelled a_1(1)* 21 to 22 labelled a_1(1)* 22 to 23 labelled a_1(1)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(1)* 24 to 25 labelled b_1(1)* 24 to 53 labelled a_1(2)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(1)* 26 to 27 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 21 labelled a_1(1)* 27 to 28 labelled a_1(1)* 28 to 4 labelled b_1(1)* 28 to 21 labelled a_1(1)* 37 to 38 labelled a_1(1)* 38 to 39 labelled a_1(1)* 39 to 40 labelled a_1(1)* 40 to 41 labelled b_1(1)* 41 to 42 labelled a_1(1)* 42 to 43 labelled b_1(1)* 42 to 61 labelled a_1(2)* 43 to 44 labelled a_1(1)* 44 to 22 labelled b_1(1)* 53 to 54 labelled a_1(2)* 54 to 55 labelled a_1(2)* 55 to 56 labelled a_1(2)* 56 to 57 labelled b_1(2)* 57 to 58 labelled a_1(2)* 58 to 59 labelled b_1(2)* 58 to 61 labelled a_1(2)* 59 to 60 labelled a_1(2)* 60 to 22 labelled b_1(2)* 61 to 62 labelled a_1(2)* 62 to 63 labelled a_1(2)* 63 to 64 labelled a_1(2)* 64 to 65 labelled b_1(2)* 65 to 66 labelled a_1(2)* 66 to 67 labelled b_1(2)* 66 to 85 labelled a_1(3)* 67 to 68 labelled a_1(2)* 68 to 53 labelled b_1(2)* 85 to 86 labelled a_1(3)* 86 to 87 labelled a_1(3)* 87 to 88 labelled a_1(3)* 88 to 89 labelled b_1(3)* 89 to 90 labelled a_1(3)* 90 to 91 labelled b_1(3)* 91 to 92 labelled a_1(3)* 92 to 56 labelled b_1(3)

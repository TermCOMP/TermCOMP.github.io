(10) TRUE


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(c(b(x1))))
   b(c(x1)) -> x1
   c(b(x1)) -> a(c(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(c(b(a(x1))))
   c(b(x1)) -> x1
   b(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(x1)) -> B(c(b(a(x1))))
   A(a(x1)) -> C(b(a(x1)))
   A(a(x1)) -> B(a(x1))
   B(c(x1)) -> C(a(x1))
   B(c(x1)) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(c(b(a(x1))))
   c(b(x1)) -> x1
   b(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(c(x1)) -> A(x1)
   A(a(x1)) -> B(c(b(a(x1))))
   A(a(x1)) -> B(a(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(c(b(a(x1))))
   c(b(x1)) -> x1
   b(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(a(x1)) -> B(c(b(a(x1))))
   A(a(x1)) -> B(a(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(B(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [-I], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, -I, 0A], [-I, 0A, -I], [0A, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(A(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[1A, 1A, 0A], [0A, 0A, -I], [0A, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, 0A], [-I, 0A, 0A], [0A, 0A, 1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(c(b(a(x1))))
   b(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))
   c(b(x1)) -> x1

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(c(x1)) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(c(b(a(x1))))
   c(b(x1)) -> x1
   b(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(9) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 1 less node.

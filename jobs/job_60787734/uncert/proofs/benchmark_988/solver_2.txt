Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(x1))) -> c(c(a(a(a(x1)))))
   a(c(x1)) -> b(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

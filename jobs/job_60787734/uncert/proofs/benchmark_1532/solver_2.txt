Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130

Node 111 is start node and node 112 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 111 to 113 labelled b_1(0)* 112 to 112 labelled #_1(0)* 113 to 114 labelled a_1(0)* 114 to 115 labelled a_1(0)* 115 to 116 labelled a_1(0)* 116 to 117 labelled b_1(0)* 117 to 118 labelled a_1(0)* 117 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 118 to 119 labelled a_1(0)* 118 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 119 to 120 labelled a_1(0)* 119 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 120 to 121 labelled a_1(0)* 120 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 121 to 112 labelled a_1(0)* 121 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 122 to 123 labelled a_1(1)* 123 to 124 labelled a_1(1)* 124 to 125 labelled a_1(1)* 125 to 126 labelled b_1(1)* 126 to 127 labelled a_1(1)* 126 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 127 to 128 labelled a_1(1)* 127 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 128 to 129 labelled a_1(1)* 128 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 129 to 130 labelled a_1(1)* 129 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 130 to 112 labelled a_1(1)* 130 to 122 labelled b_1(1)

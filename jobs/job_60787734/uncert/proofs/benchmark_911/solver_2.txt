(8) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B(b(a(a(x1)))) -> B(b(b(x1)))
   B(b(a(a(x1)))) -> B(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic integers [ARCTIC,STERNAGEL_THIEMANN_RTA14]:

   <<<
 POL(B(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, -1A, -1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [-1A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[-I, -I, 0A], [-I, -I, -1A], [0A, 1A, -1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [1A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-1A, 0A, 0A], [0A, -1A, -1A], [-1A, -1A, -1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   a(b(x1)) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))

----------------------------------------

(19) UsableRulesReductionPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the usable rules with reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with a polynomial ordering [POLO], all dependency pairs and the corresponding usable rules [FROCOS05] can be oriented non-strictly. All non-usable rules are removed, and those dependency pairs and usable rules that have been oriented strictly or contain non-usable symbols in their left-hand side are removed as well.

The following dependency pairs can be deleted:

   B.1(b.0(a.0(a.0(x1)))) -> B.1(b.0(x1))
The following rules are removed from R:

   b.1(b.0(a.0(a.0(x1)))) -> a.1(b.0(b.1(b.0(x1))))
   b.1(b.0(a.0(a.1(x1)))) -> a.0(b.1(b.0(b.1(x1))))
   a.1(b.0(x1)) -> a.0(a.0(a.0(a.0(x1))))
   a.0(b.1(x1)) -> a.0(a.0(a.0(a.1(x1))))
Used ordering: POLO with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B.1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a.0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b.0(x_1)) = x_1

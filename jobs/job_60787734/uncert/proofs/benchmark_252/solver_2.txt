As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   AB_{A_1}^2(A_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))) -> AB_{A_1}^1(x1)

R is empty.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   AB_{A_1}^2(A_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))) -> AB_{A_1}^1(x1)
   AB_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> AB_{A_1}^2(A_{b_1}(x1))

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(35) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   AB_{A_1}^2(A_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))) -> AB_{A_1}^1(x1)
   AB_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> AB_{A_1}^2(A_{b_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(AB_{A_1}^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(AB_{A_1}^2(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(A_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:
none

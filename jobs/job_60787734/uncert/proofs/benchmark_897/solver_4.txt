Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 1 0 1 ,
  1 0 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 }

Inverting the length-preserving system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 0 1 ⟶ 0 0 0 0 ,
  0 1 0 ⟶ 1 0 1 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 1 ,
  1 0 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 }

Applying the dependency pairs transformation [Arts, CAAP 1996], [Arts/Giesl, RTA 1996].
  Here, ↑ marks so-called defined symbols.
After renaming modulo the bijection { (0,↑) ↦ 0, (1,↓) ↦ 1, (0,↓) ↦ 2, (1,↑) ↦ 3 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 8-rules system (6 strict rules)

Removing 4 rules by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(c(a(b(c(x1)))))) -> a(b(b(c(b(c(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(b(a(c(b(b(x1)))))) -> a(c(b(c(b(b(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 0. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   c(b(a(c(b(b(x1)))))) -> a(c(b(c(b(b(a(x1)))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

Node 9 is start node and node 10 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 9 to 11 labelled a_1(0)* 10 to 10 labelled #_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled c_1(0)* 12 to 13 labelled b_1(0)* 13 to 14 labelled c_1(0)* 14 to 15 labelled b_1(0)* 15 to 16 labelled b_1(0)* 16 to 10 labelled a_1(0)

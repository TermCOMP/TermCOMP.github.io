Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x1)
(RULES
b(b(c(a(b(c(x1)))))) -> a(b(b(c(b(c(a(x1)))))))
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 b(b(c(a(b(c(x1)))))) -> a(b(b(c(b(c(a(x1)))))))
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.

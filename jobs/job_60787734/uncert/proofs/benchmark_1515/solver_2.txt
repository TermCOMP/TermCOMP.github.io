The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

   A(b(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(b(b(b(x1)))) -> A(b(a(x1)))
   A(b(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))
   A(b(b(b(x1)))) -> A(x1)

   B(a(a(a(x1)))) -> A(a(b(x1)))
   B(a(a(a(x1)))) -> A(b(x1))
   B(a(a(a(x1)))) -> B(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> b(a(b(c(c(b(x1))))))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> b(c(c(b(a(b(x1))))))
   b(c(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(x1)
   b(a(x1)) -> b(x1)
   c(a(x1)) -> c(x1)
   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(b(c(c(b(a(b(x1)))))))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> b(b(c(c(b(a(b(x1)))))))
   c(a(a(x1))) -> c(b(c(c(b(a(b(x1)))))))
   a(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(x1))
   b(b(c(x1))) -> b(a(x1))
   c(b(c(x1))) -> c(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

(16) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*C_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> C_{A_1}(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   a(x1) -> b(b(c(x1)))
   c(a(b(x1))) -> a(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

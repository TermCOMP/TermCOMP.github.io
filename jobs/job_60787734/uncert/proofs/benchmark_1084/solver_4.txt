Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  1 0 0 0 ⟶ 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 }

Incorporating context-free projections into matching.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 }

Loop of length 16 starting with a source of size 13.

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))) -> a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))) -> a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44

Node 23 is start node and node 24 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 23 to 25 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 24 labelled #_1(0)* 25 to 26 labelled b_1(0)* 26 to 27 labelled b_1(0)* 27 to 28 labelled a_1(0)* 28 to 29 labelled b_1(0)* 28 to 35 labelled a_1(1)* 29 to 30 labelled a_1(0)* 30 to 31 labelled b_1(0)* 30 to 35 labelled a_1(1)* 31 to 32 labelled a_1(0)* 32 to 33 labelled b_1(0)* 32 to 35 labelled a_1(1)* 33 to 34 labelled a_1(0)* 34 to 24 labelled b_1(0)* 34 to 35 labelled a_1(1)* 35 to 36 labelled b_1(1)* 36 to 37 labelled b_1(1)* 37 to 38 labelled a_1(1)* 38 to 39 labelled b_1(1)* 38 to 35 labelled a_1(1)* 39 to 40 labelled a_1(1)* 40 to 41 labelled b_1(1)* 40 to 35 labelled a_1(1)* 41 to 42 labelled a_1(1)* 42 to 43 labelled b_1(1)* 42 to 35 labelled a_1(1)* 43 to 44 labelled a_1(1)* 44 to 24 labelled b_1(1)* 44 to 35 labelled a_1(1)

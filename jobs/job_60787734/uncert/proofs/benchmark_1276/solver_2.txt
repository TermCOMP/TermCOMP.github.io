Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS
(1) NonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 10.3 s]
(2) NO

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   b(a(b(c(x1)))) -> b(c(c(a(a(a(x1))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

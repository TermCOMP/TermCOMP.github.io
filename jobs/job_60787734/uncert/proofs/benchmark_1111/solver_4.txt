Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 ⟶ 1 ,
  0 1 2 ⟶ 2 2 1 0 0 ,
  2 ⟶ }

Loop of length 11 starting with a source of size 9.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2
    Applying rule 0 1 2 ⟶ 2 2 1 0 0 at position 0 results in
2 2 1 0 0 1 2 2 1 2 2
    Applying rule 0 1 2 ⟶ 2 2 1 0 0 at position 4 results in
2 2 1 0 2 2 1 0 0 2 1 2 2
    Applying rule 0 ⟶ 1 at position 8 results in
2 2 1 0 2 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 2
    Applying rule 0 1 2 ⟶ 2 2 1 0 0 at position 7 results in
2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 1 0 0 1 2 2
    Applying rule 0 1 2 ⟶ 2 2 1 0 0 at position 10 results in
2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 0 0 2
    Applying rule 0 ⟶ 1 at position 14 results in
2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 0 1 2
    Applying rule 0 1 2 ⟶ 2 2 1 0 0 at position 13 results in

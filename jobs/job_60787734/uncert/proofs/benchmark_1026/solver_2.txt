Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))) -> b(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   b(a(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))) -> b(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   a(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(b(b(b(a(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(b(b(b(a(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(b(b(b(a(x1))))))) -> b(a(b(b(b(a(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(b(a(b(b(b(a(x1))))))) -> b(a(b(b(b(a(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112

Node 1 is start node and node 3 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))

P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(23) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.

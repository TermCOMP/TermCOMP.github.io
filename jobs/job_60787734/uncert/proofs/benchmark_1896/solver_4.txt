Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ,
  0 2 ⟶ 2 0 ,
  1 2 ⟶ 2 1 }

Applying sparse untiling TRFCU(2) after reversal [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, FSCD 2019].
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 0 0 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 0 0 }

Applying the dependency pairs transformation [Arts, CAAP 1996], [Arts/Giesl, RTA 1996].
  Here, ↑ marks so-called defined symbols.
After renaming modulo the bijection { (0,↑) ↦ 0, (0,↓) ↦ 1, (1,↓) ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 2 2 ⟶ 0 1 1 ,
  0 1 2 2 ⟶ 0 1 ,
  0 1 2 2 ⟶ 0 ,
  1 1 2 2 →= 2 2 2 1 1 1 }

Removing 3 rules by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 5:

0 ↦ ⎛           ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 1 0 0 ⎟

    ⎝           ⎠

    ⎜ 0 0 0 0 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 2 1 0 ⎟
    ⎝           ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 2 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (0 strict rules)
{ 0 0 1 1 →= 1 1 1 0 0 0 }

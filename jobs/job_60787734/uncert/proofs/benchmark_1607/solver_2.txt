Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112

Node 15 is start node and node 16 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 15 to 17 labelled b_1(0)* 16 to 16 labelled #_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled a_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled b_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled a_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled b_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 25 labelled b_1(0)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(0)* 25 to 101 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 27 labelled a_1(0)* 26 to 101 labelled b_1(1)* 27 to 28 labelled a_1(0)* 27 to 101 labelled b_1(1)* 28 to 16 labelled a_1(0)* 28 to 101 labelled b_1(1)* 101 to 102 labelled a_1(1)* 102 to 103 labelled a_1(1)* 103 to 104 labelled b_1(1)* 104 to 105 labelled a_1(1)* 105 to 106 labelled b_1(1)* 106 to 107 labelled a_1(1)* 107 to 108 labelled a_1(1)* 108 to 109 labelled b_1(1)* 109 to 110 labelled a_1(1)* 109 to 101 labelled b_1(1)* 110 to 111 labelled a_1(1)* 110 to 101 labelled b_1(1)* 111 to 112 labelled a_1(1)* 111 to 101 labelled b_1(1)* 112 to 16 labelled a_1(1)* 112 to 101 labelled b_1(1)

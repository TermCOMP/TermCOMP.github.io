The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   2^1(0(1(5(4(x1))))) -> 1^1(x1)
   2^1(5(3(0(x1)))) -> 1^1(2(0(x1)))
   1^1(2(3(5(0(x1))))) -> 1^1(3(2(0(x1))))

   2^1(5(3(0(x1)))) -> 2^1(0(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

   POL(5^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   1^1(0(2(x1))) -> 1^1(1(2(0(x1))))
   1^1(0(2(x1))) -> 1^1(2(0(x1)))
   1^1(4(2(2(x1)))) -> 1^1(3(2(2(4(x1)))))
   1^1(4(2(2(x1)))) -> 2^1(2(4(x1)))
   1^1(4(2(2(x1)))) -> 2^1(4(x1))
   1^1(0(2(4(2(x1))))) -> 2^1(1(1(2(x1))))
   1^1(0(2(4(2(x1))))) -> 1^1(1(2(x1)))

   1^1(4(3(5(2(x1))))) -> 1^1(5(x1))
   1^1(4(3(5(2(x1))))) -> 5^1(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 1
   POL(1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 0
   POL(2^1(x_1)) = 0
   POL(3(x_1)) = 0
   POL(3^1(x_1)) = 0
   POL(4(x_1)) = 1
   POL(5(x_1)) = 0
   POL(5^1(x_1)) = 0

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   2(0(1(0(x1)))) -> 1(1(1(2(0(0(x1))))))
   2(0(1(5(4(x1))))) -> 5(1(2(4(0(1(x1))))))

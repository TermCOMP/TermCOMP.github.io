Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))
   a(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))
   b(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> b(b(b(b(b(x1)))))
   a(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> a(b(b(b(b(x1)))))
   b(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))
   a(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

Q is empty.

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{A_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(A_{B_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(B_{A_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(B_{B_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> B_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

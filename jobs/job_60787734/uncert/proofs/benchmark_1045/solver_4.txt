Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 2 0 0 ,
  1 1 ⟶ 2 0 1 ,
  2 ⟶ }

  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 0 0 0 0
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 2 0 0 at position 0 results in
1 1 2 0 0 0 0
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 2 0 1 at position 0 results in
2 0 1 2 0 0 0 0
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 2 0 0 at position 3 results in

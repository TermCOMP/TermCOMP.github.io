(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(x1)
   A(a(b(x1))) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(x1)
   A(a(b(x1))) -> A(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

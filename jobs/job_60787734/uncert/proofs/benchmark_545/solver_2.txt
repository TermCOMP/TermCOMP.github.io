We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   1^1(1(0(x1))) -> 1^1(5(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 0
   POL(3(x_1)) = 0
   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   5(1(1(0(x1)))) -> 2(1(5(3(1(0(x1))))))
   5(4(1(0(x1)))) -> 1(5(0(4(3(x1)))))
   5(4(1(0(x1)))) -> 1(0(3(5(4(3(x1))))))

(21) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem.

*4^1(2(5(0(5(x1))))) -> 4^1(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81

Node 58 is start node and node 59 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 58 to 60 labelled b_1(0)* 59 to 59 labelled #_1(0)* 60 to 61 labelled a_1(0)* 61 to 62 labelled a_1(0)* 62 to 63 labelled b_1(0)* 63 to 64 labelled b_1(0)* 64 to 65 labelled a_1(0)* 65 to 66 labelled a_1(0)* 65 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 66 to 67 labelled b_1(0)* 67 to 68 labelled a_1(0)* 67 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 68 to 69 labelled b_1(0)* 69 to 70 labelled a_1(0)* 69 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 70 to 59 labelled b_1(0)* 71 to 72 labelled a_1(1)* 72 to 73 labelled a_1(1)* 73 to 74 labelled b_1(1)* 74 to 75 labelled b_1(1)* 75 to 76 labelled a_1(1)* 76 to 77 labelled a_1(1)* 76 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 77 to 78 labelled b_1(1)* 78 to 79 labelled a_1(1)* 78 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 79 to 80 labelled b_1(1)* 80 to 81 labelled a_1(1)* 80 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 81 to 59 labelled b_1(1)

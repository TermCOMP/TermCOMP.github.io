Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 4. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

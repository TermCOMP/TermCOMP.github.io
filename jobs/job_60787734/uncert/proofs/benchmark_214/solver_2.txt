The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   B(a(x1)) -> BA(x1)
   B(b(x1)) -> B(B(x1))
   BA(a(x1)) -> BAA(x1)
   BA(b(x1)) -> BA(B(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

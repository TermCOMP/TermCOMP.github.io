Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2, d ↦ 3 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ 1 2 ,
  0 1 ⟶ 1 0 ,
  3 2 ⟶ 3 0 ,
  0 2 ⟶ 2 0 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 3:

0 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 0 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

3 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 0 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ 1 2 ,
  0 1 ⟶ 1 0 ,
  0 2 ⟶ 2 0 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟

2 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 ,
  0 2 ⟶ 2 0 }

Removing 2 relatively RFC-match-bounded rules [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, WST 2022]
  (bounded by 3 for B = 5). The certifying automaton has 4 epsilon transitions:
  { (0,1,1) ⟶ (0,0,0), (0,1,1) ⟶ (0,1,0), (0,0,1) ⟶ (0,0,0), (0,0,1) ⟶ (0,1,0) }
After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)
{ }

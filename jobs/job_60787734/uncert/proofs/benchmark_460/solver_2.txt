By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   0^1(4(4(0(x1)))) -> 0^1(4(0(x1)))
   0^1(4(3(4(x1)))) -> 0^1(4(x1))
   0^1(4(3(4(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)
   0^1(0(0(4(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)
   0^1(0(4(4(1(x1))))) -> 1^1(4(x1))
   1^1(4(0(0(x1)))) -> 0^1(1(x1))
   0^1(0(1(3(4(x1))))) -> 1^1(x1)
   0^1(5(1(3(4(x1))))) -> 1^1(x1)
   0^1(4(5(3(4(x1))))) -> 0^1(x1)

   1^1(5(5(3(4(x1))))) -> 1^1(x1)
   1^1(0(0(4(4(x1))))) -> 0^1(4(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(0^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 0
   POL(3(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(24) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*1^1(0(5(3(0(x1))))) -> 1^1(0(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*1^1(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 1^1(0(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

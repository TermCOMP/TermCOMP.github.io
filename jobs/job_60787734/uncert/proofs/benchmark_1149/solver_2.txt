Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(c(b(a(c(x1))))))
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(c(x1)) -> x1

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   b(a(x1)) -> c(a(b(c(a(b(x1))))))
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(c(x1)) -> x1

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(x1)
   b(a(x1)) -> b(x1)
   c(a(x1)) -> c(x1)
   a(b(a(x1))) -> a(c(a(b(c(a(b(x1)))))))
   b(b(a(x1))) -> b(c(a(b(c(a(b(x1)))))))
   c(b(a(x1))) -> c(c(a(b(c(a(b(x1)))))))
   a(b(x1)) -> a(x1)
   b(b(x1)) -> b(x1)
   c(b(x1)) -> c(x1)
   a(c(c(x1))) -> a(x1)
   b(c(c(x1))) -> b(x1)
   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> a_{b_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)) -> a_{c_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> b_{a_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)) -> b_{c_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> c_{a_1}(x1)
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)) -> c_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(x1)
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(x1)

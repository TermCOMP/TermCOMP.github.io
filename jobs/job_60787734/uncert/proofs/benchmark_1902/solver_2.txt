Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(l(x1)) -> l(a(x1))
   a(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))
   c(a(r(x1))) -> r(a(x1))
   l(r(a(x1))) -> a(l(c(c(r(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(l(x1)) -> l(a(x1))
   a(c(x1)) -> c(a(x1))
   c(a(r(x1))) -> r(a(x1))
   l(r(a(x1))) -> a(l(c(c(r(x1)))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 40, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))) -> b(c(b(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))) -> b(c(b(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172

Node 147 is start node and node 148 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 147 to 149 labelled b_1(0)* 148 to 148 labelled #_1(0)* 149 to 150 labelled c_1(0)* 150 to 151 labelled b_1(0)* 151 to 152 labelled a_1(0)* 152 to 153 labelled a_1(0)* 153 to 154 labelled a_1(0)* 154 to 155 labelled b_1(0)* 155 to 156 labelled c_1(0)* 156 to 157 labelled b_1(0)* 157 to 158 labelled a_1(0)* 157 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 158 to 159 labelled a_1(0)* 158 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 159 to 160 labelled a_1(0)* 159 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 160 to 148 labelled a_1(0)* 160 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 161 to 162 labelled c_1(1)* 162 to 163 labelled b_1(1)* 163 to 164 labelled a_1(1)* 164 to 165 labelled a_1(1)* 165 to 166 labelled a_1(1)* 166 to 167 labelled b_1(1)* 167 to 168 labelled c_1(1)* 168 to 169 labelled b_1(1)* 169 to 170 labelled a_1(1)* 169 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 170 to 171 labelled a_1(1)* 170 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 171 to 172 labelled a_1(1)* 171 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 172 to 148 labelled a_1(1)* 172 to 161 labelled b_1(1)

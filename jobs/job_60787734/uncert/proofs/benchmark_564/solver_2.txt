The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(0^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(4^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5^1(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   0(0(1(0(x1)))) -> 1(0(0(2(0(2(x1))))))
   0(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 1(3(0(0(3(1(x1))))))

(18) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   4^1(0(5(5(4(x1))))) -> 4^1(5(0(4(5(x1)))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( 4^1_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1 + 2
POL( 5_1(x_1) ) = max{0, x_1 - 2}
POL( 1_1(x_1) ) = 2
POL( 0_1(x_1) ) = 2
POL( 2_1(x_1) ) = 1
POL( 4_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1
POL( 3_1(x_1) ) = max{0, -2}

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> b(c(x1))
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(x1) -> x1
   c(b(x1)) -> b(a(c(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

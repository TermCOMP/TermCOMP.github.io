Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 ,
  1 2 ⟶ 2 1 1 ,
  2 0 ⟶ 0 2 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 3:

0 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 0 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 2 ↦ 1, 0 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 ,
  1 2 ⟶ 2 1 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 3:

0 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 0 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛       ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 1 ⎟
    ⎝       ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 0 }

Removing 1 relatively right barren rule [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, WST 2022].
  The certifying automaton has 1 epsilon transition:
  { (0,0,2) ⟶ (0,0,0) }
After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)
{ }

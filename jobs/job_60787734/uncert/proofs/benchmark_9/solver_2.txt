Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(x1)
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(b(b(x1)))
   b(b(x1)) -> a(b(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 0 1 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 }

  Here, ↑ marks so-called defined symbols.
After renaming modulo the bijection { (0,↑) ↦ 0, (0,↓) ↦ 1, (1,↓) ↦ 2 },

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(a(x1))))) -> a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 4. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(b(a(a(x1))))) -> a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 3, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109

Node 1 is start node and node 3 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

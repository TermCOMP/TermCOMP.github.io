Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))
   c(c(x1)) -> a(b(c(x1)))
   c(b(x1)) -> b(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> b(a(c(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"a c (b)^k c -> b a c (b)^k+1 c"
a c (b)^k c -> b a c (b)^k+1 c

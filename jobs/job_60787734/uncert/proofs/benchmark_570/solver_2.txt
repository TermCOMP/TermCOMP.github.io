(6) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

(8) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*0^1(5(5(2(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*0^1(1(2(x1))) -> 0^1(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*0^1(2(4(3(1(x1))))) -> 0^1(x1)

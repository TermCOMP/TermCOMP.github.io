Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(a(a(b(a(x1))))) -> a(a(b(a(c(c(a(a(b(x1)))))))))

Q is empty.

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"c a a b a a a -> a a b a c a a b a a a b a c c a a b c c a a b"
c a a b a a a -> a a b a c a a b a a a b a c c a a b c c a a b

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(c(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(c(b(x1))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled b_1(0)* 1 to 6 labelled a_1(0)* 1 to 13 labelled a_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 2 labelled a_1(0)* 5 to 16 labelled b_1(1)* 5 to 17 labelled a_1(2)* 6 to 7 labelled a_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled c_1(0)* 8 to 2 labelled b_1(0)* 8 to 13 labelled a_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 14 to 15 labelled c_1(1)* 15 to 2 labelled b_1(1)* 15 to 13 labelled a_1(1)* 15 to 17 labelled b_1(1)* 15 to 30 labelled a_1(2)* 16 to 2 labelled a_1(1)* 16 to 16 labelled b_1(1)* 16 to 17 labelled a_1(2)* 17 to 18 labelled a_1(2)* 18 to 19 labelled c_1(2)* 19 to 2 labelled b_1(2)* 19 to 13 labelled a_1(1)* 19 to 17 labelled b_1(2)* 19 to 36 labelled a_1(3)* 30 to 31 labelled a_1(2)* 31 to 32 labelled c_1(2)* 32 to 18 labelled b_1(2)* 36 to 37 labelled a_1(3)* 37 to 38 labelled c_1(3)* 38 to 18 labelled b_1(3)

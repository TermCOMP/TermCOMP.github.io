Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(c(b(a(a(x1))))))
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(c(x1)) -> x1

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

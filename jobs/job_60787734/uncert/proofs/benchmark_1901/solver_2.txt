Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(d(x1)) -> d(b(x1))
   a(x1) -> b(b(b(x1)))
   d(x1) -> x1
   a(x1) -> x1
   b(d(b(x1))) -> a(d(x1))
   b(c(x1)) -> c(d(d(x1)))
   a(c(x1)) -> b(b(c(d(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(d(x1)) -> D(b(x1))
   A(d(x1)) -> B(x1)
   A(x1) -> B(b(b(x1)))
   A(x1) -> B(b(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(d(x1)) -> d(b(x1))
   a(x1) -> b(b(b(x1)))
   d(x1) -> x1
   a(x1) -> x1
   b(d(b(x1))) -> a(d(x1))
   b(c(x1)) -> c(d(d(x1)))
   a(c(x1)) -> b(b(c(d(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 6 less nodes.

----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(d(x1)) -> B(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 0
   POL(d(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   d(x1) -> x1
   a(x1) -> b(b(b(x1)))
   b(d(b(x1))) -> a(d(x1))
   a(c(x1)) -> b(b(c(d(x1))))
   b(c(x1)) -> c(d(d(x1)))

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265

Node 246 is start node and node 247 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 246 to 248 labelled a_1(0)* 247 to 247 labelled #_1(0)* 248 to 249 labelled b_1(0)* 249 to 250 labelled a_1(0)* 250 to 251 labelled b_1(0)* 251 to 252 labelled a_1(0)* 252 to 253 labelled a_1(0)* 253 to 254 labelled b_1(0)* 253 to 257 labelled a_1(1)* 254 to 255 labelled a_1(0)* 255 to 256 labelled a_1(0)* 256 to 247 labelled b_1(0)* 256 to 257 labelled a_1(1)* 257 to 258 labelled b_1(1)* 258 to 259 labelled a_1(1)* 259 to 260 labelled b_1(1)* 260 to 261 labelled a_1(1)* 261 to 262 labelled a_1(1)* 262 to 263 labelled b_1(1)* 262 to 257 labelled a_1(1)* 263 to 264 labelled a_1(1)* 264 to 265 labelled a_1(1)* 265 to 247 labelled b_1(1)* 265 to 257 labelled a_1(1)

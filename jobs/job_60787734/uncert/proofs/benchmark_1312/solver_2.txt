(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(c(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> x1
   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(c(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> x1
   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(b(x1))) -> A(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(A(x_1)) =  	[[-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[-I], [0A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, 1A], [-I, -I, 0A], [0A, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[-I], [0A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, 0A], [1A, -I, 0A], [0A, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[-I], [-I], [-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, -I], [0A, -I, -I], [-I, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(x1) -> b(c(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> x1
   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))


----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(c(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> x1
   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

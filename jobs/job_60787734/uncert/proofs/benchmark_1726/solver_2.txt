(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x)))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x)))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64

Node 1 is start node and node 3 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 3 to 3 labelled #_1(0)* 4 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled b_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled a_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled a_1(0)* 8 to 9 labelled a_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled b_1(0)* 9 to 55 labelled a_1(1)* 10 to 11 labelled a_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled b_1(0)* 11 to 55 labelled a_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled a_1(0)* 13 to 3 labelled b_1(0)* 13 to 55 labelled a_1(1)* 55 to 56 labelled a_1(1)* 56 to 57 labelled b_1(1)* 57 to 58 labelled a_1(1)* 58 to 59 labelled a_1(1)* 59 to 60 labelled a_1(1)* 60 to 61 labelled b_1(1)* 60 to 55 labelled a_1(1)* 61 to 62 labelled a_1(1)* 62 to 63 labelled b_1(1)* 62 to 55 labelled a_1(1)* 63 to 64 labelled a_1(1)* 64 to 3 labelled b_1(1)* 64 to 55 labelled a_1(1)

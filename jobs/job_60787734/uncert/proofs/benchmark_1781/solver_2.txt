Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   b(c(x1)) -> c(b(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   c(b(x1)) -> b(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   c(b(x1)) -> b(c(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(a(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 38, 39, 41, 42, 51, 52, 53, 54

Node 6 is start node and node 8 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 6 to 10 labelled a_1(0)* 6 to 12 labelled b_1(0)* 6 to 13 labelled a_1(0)* 6 to 20 labelled a_1(1)* 8 to 8 labelled #_1(0)* 10 to 11 labelled a_1(0)* 10 to 33 labelled a_1(1)* 11 to 8 labelled b_1(0)* 11 to 22 labelled a_1(1)* 11 to 41 labelled a_1(2)* 12 to 8 labelled c_1(0)* 12 to 24 labelled b_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled c_1(0)* 14 to 8 labelled a_1(0)* 14 to 25 labelled a_1(1)* 20 to 21 labelled c_1(1)* 21 to 11 labelled a_1(1)* 21 to 38 labelled a_1(2)* 21 to 33 labelled a_1(1)* 22 to 23 labelled a_1(1)* 22 to 38 labelled a_1(2)* 23 to 8 labelled b_1(1)* 23 to 22 labelled a_1(1)* 23 to 41 labelled a_1(2)* 24 to 8 labelled c_1(1)* 24 to 24 labelled b_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled c_1(1)* 26 to 8 labelled a_1(1)* 26 to 25 labelled a_1(1)* 33 to 34 labelled c_1(1)* 34 to 22 labelled a_1(1)* 34 to 41 labelled a_1(1), a_1(2)* 38 to 39 labelled c_1(2)* 39 to 22 labelled a_1(2)* 39 to 41 labelled a_1(2)* 39 to 51 labelled a_1(3)* 41 to 42 labelled c_1(2)* 42 to 23 labelled a_1(2)* 42 to 38 labelled a_1(2)* 42 to 53 labelled a_1(3)* 51 to 52 labelled c_1(3)* 52 to 38 labelled a_1(3)* 53 to 54 labelled c_1(3)* 54 to 41 labelled a_1(3)

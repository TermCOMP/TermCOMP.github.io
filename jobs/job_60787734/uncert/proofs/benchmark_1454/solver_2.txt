Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   a(b(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(x1)
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(x1)
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(x1)
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(x1)
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( B_{A_1}_1(x_1) ) = max{0, x_1 - 2}
POL( A_{B_1}_1(x_1) ) = max{0, 2x_1 - 2}
POL( b_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1
POL( b_{b_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1 + 1
POL( a_{b_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1 + 1
POL( a_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1 + 1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 1 less node.

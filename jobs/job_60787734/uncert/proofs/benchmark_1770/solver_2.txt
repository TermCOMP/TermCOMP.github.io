----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(b(x1))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   b(x1) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(c(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(c(a(x1))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   b(x1) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(c(a(x1))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   b(x1) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(a(x1))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120

Node 11 is start node and node 12 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 11 to 13 labelled a_1(0)* 11 to 16 labelled c_1(0)* 11 to 18 labelled a_1(0)* 12 to 12 labelled #_1(0)* 13 to 14 labelled b_1(0)* 13 to 93 labelled c_1(1)* 14 to 15 labelled a_1(0)* 14 to 111 labelled a_1(1)* 15 to 12 labelled b_1(0)* 15 to 95 labelled c_1(1)* 15 to 99 labelled a_1(1)* 16 to 17 labelled a_1(0)* 17 to 12 labelled c_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled c_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled b_1(0)* 19 to 97 labelled c_1(1)* 20 to 12 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 102 labelled a_1(1)* 93 to 94 labelled a_1(1)* 94 to 14 labelled c_1(1)* 95 to 96 labelled a_1(1)* 96 to 12 labelled c_1(1)* 97 to 98 labelled a_1(1)* 98 to 20 labelled c_1(1)* 99 to 100 labelled b_1(1)* 99 to 105 labelled c_1(2)* 100 to 101 labelled a_1(1)* 100 to 116 labelled a_1(2)* 101 to 12 labelled b_1(1)* 101 to 107 labelled c_1(2)* 101 to 99 labelled a_1(1)* 102 to 103 labelled c_1(1)* 103 to 104 labelled b_1(1)* 103 to 109 labelled c_1(2)* 104 to 12 labelled a_1(1)* 104 to 102 labelled a_1(1)* 105 to 106 labelled a_1(2)* 106 to 100 labelled c_1(2)* 107 to 108 labelled a_1(2)* 108 to 12 labelled c_1(2)* 109 to 110 labelled a_1(2)* 110 to 104 labelled c_1(2)* 111 to 112 labelled c_1(1)* 112 to 113 labelled b_1(1)* 112 to 114 labelled c_1(2)* 113 to 99 labelled a_1(1)* 114 to 115 labelled a_1(2)* 115 to 113 labelled c_1(2)* 116 to 117 labelled c_1(2)* 117 to 118 labelled b_1(2)* 117 to 119 labelled c_1(3)* 118 to 99 labelled a_1(2)* 119 to 120 labelled a_1(3)* 120 to 118 labelled c_1(3)

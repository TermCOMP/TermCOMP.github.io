Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   b(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(b(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(x))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(x))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(a(b(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(x))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220

Node 183 is start node and node 184 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 183 to 185 labelled a_1(0)* 184 to 184 labelled #_1(0)* 185 to 186 labelled a_1(0)* 186 to 187 labelled b_1(0)* 187 to 188 labelled b_1(0)* 188 to 189 labelled a_1(0)* 189 to 190 labelled a_1(0)* 190 to 191 labelled a_1(0)* 191 to 192 labelled a_1(0)* 192 to 193 labelled b_1(0)* 192 to 203 labelled a_1(1)* 193 to 184 labelled b_1(0)* 193 to 194 labelled a_1(1)* 194 to 195 labelled a_1(1)* 195 to 196 labelled b_1(1)* 196 to 197 labelled b_1(1)* 197 to 198 labelled a_1(1)* 198 to 199 labelled a_1(1)* 199 to 200 labelled a_1(1)* 200 to 201 labelled a_1(1)* 201 to 202 labelled b_1(1)* 201 to 212 labelled a_1(2)* 202 to 184 labelled b_1(1)* 202 to 194 labelled a_1(1)* 203 to 204 labelled a_1(1)* 204 to 205 labelled b_1(1)* 205 to 206 labelled b_1(1)* 206 to 207 labelled a_1(1)* 207 to 208 labelled a_1(1)* 208 to 209 labelled a_1(1)* 209 to 210 labelled a_1(1)* 210 to 211 labelled b_1(1)* 210 to 212 labelled a_1(2)* 211 to 199 labelled b_1(1)* 211 to 194 labelled a_1(1)* 212 to 213 labelled a_1(2)* 213 to 214 labelled b_1(2)* 214 to 215 labelled b_1(2)* 215 to 216 labelled a_1(2)* 216 to 217 labelled a_1(2)* 217 to 218 labelled a_1(2)* 218 to 219 labelled a_1(2)* 219 to 220 labelled b_1(2)* 219 to 212 labelled a_1(2)* 220 to 199 labelled b_1(2)* 220 to 194 labelled a_1(1)

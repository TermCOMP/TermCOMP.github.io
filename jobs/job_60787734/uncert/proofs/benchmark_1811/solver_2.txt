Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(c(a(b(c(a(b(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(c(x1)))) -> b(a(c(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(c(x1)))) -> b(a(c(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

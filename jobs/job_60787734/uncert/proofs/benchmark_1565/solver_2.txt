(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(b(a(a(b(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(b(b(a(a(b(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(b(a(x1))))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(a(x1))))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(a(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(a(a(x1)))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148

Node 123 is start node and node 124 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 123 to 125 labelled b_1(0)* 124 to 124 labelled #_1(0)* 125 to 126 labelled a_1(0)* 126 to 127 labelled a_1(0)* 127 to 128 labelled b_1(0)* 128 to 129 labelled b_1(0)* 129 to 130 labelled a_1(0)* 129 to 137 labelled b_1(1)* 130 to 124 labelled a_1(0)* 130 to 131 labelled b_1(1)* 131 to 132 labelled a_1(1)* 132 to 133 labelled a_1(1)* 133 to 134 labelled b_1(1)* 134 to 135 labelled b_1(1)* 135 to 136 labelled a_1(1)* 135 to 143 labelled b_1(2)* 136 to 124 labelled a_1(1)* 136 to 131 labelled b_1(1)* 137 to 138 labelled a_1(1)* 138 to 139 labelled a_1(1)* 139 to 140 labelled b_1(1)* 140 to 141 labelled b_1(1)* 141 to 142 labelled a_1(1)* 141 to 143 labelled b_1(2)* 142 to 134 labelled a_1(1)* 142 to 131 labelled b_1(1)* 143 to 144 labelled a_1(2)* 144 to 145 labelled a_1(2)* 145 to 146 labelled b_1(2)* 146 to 147 labelled b_1(2)* 147 to 148 labelled a_1(2)* 147 to 143 labelled b_1(2)* 148 to 134 labelled a_1(2)* 148 to 131 labelled b_1(1)

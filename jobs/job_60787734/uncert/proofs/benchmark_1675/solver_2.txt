Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))) -> b(b(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))) -> b(b(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103

Node 80 is start node and node 81 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 80 to 82 labelled b_1(0)* 81 to 81 labelled #_1(0)* 82 to 83 labelled b_1(0)* 83 to 84 labelled a_1(0)* 84 to 85 labelled a_1(0)* 85 to 86 labelled a_1(0)* 86 to 87 labelled b_1(0)* 87 to 88 labelled b_1(0)* 88 to 89 labelled a_1(0)* 88 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 89 to 90 labelled a_1(0)* 89 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 90 to 91 labelled a_1(0)* 90 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 91 to 92 labelled a_1(0)* 91 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 92 to 81 labelled a_1(0)* 92 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 93 to 94 labelled b_1(1)* 94 to 95 labelled a_1(1)* 95 to 96 labelled a_1(1)* 96 to 97 labelled a_1(1)* 97 to 98 labelled b_1(1)* 98 to 99 labelled b_1(1)* 99 to 100 labelled a_1(1)* 99 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 100 to 101 labelled a_1(1)* 100 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 101 to 102 labelled a_1(1)* 101 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 102 to 103 labelled a_1(1)* 102 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 103 to 81 labelled a_1(1)* 103 to 93 labelled b_1(1)

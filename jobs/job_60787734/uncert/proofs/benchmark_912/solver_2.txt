Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(L(x1))) -> L(a(L(X(b(a(b(b(x1))))))))
   b(L(x1)) -> L(b(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"b a (b)^k L a L -> L a L X b a (b)^k+1 L a L X b a b b"
b a (b)^k L a L -> L a L X b a (b)^k+1 L a L X b a b b
by Overlap u with r (ol3)"b a (b)^k L -> L a L X b a (b)^k+1 b
by Operation expand"b a (b)^k L -> L a L X b a (b)^k+2
by Equivalent"b a (b)^k L -> L a L X b a b b (b)^k
by Overlap u with l (ol4)"(b)^k L -> L (b)^k

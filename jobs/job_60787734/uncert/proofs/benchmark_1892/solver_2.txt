Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(r(x1))
   r(a(x1)) -> d(r(x1))
   r(x1) -> d(x1)
   d(a(x1)) -> a(a(d(x1)))
   d(x1) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(b(x1)) -> R(x1)
   R(a(x1)) -> D(r(x1))
   R(a(x1)) -> R(x1)
   R(x1) -> D(x1)
   D(a(x1)) -> A(a(d(x1)))
   D(a(x1)) -> A(d(x1))
   D(a(x1)) -> D(x1)
   D(x1) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(r(x1))
   r(a(x1)) -> d(r(x1))
   r(x1) -> d(x1)
   d(a(x1)) -> a(a(d(x1)))
   d(x1) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   A(b(x1)) -> R(x1)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(D(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(R(x_1)) = 3*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + 3*x_1
   POL(d(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(r(x_1)) = x_1

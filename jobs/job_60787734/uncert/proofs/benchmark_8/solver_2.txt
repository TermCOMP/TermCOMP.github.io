Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(x1))) -> b(b(b(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(b(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure:

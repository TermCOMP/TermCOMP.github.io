Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(b(b(x1)))))) -> a(b(a(b(b(b(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(a(b(b(b(x1)))))) -> a(b(a(b(b(b(a(x1)))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 3 labelled a_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled b_1(0)* 4 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled b_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled b_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled b_1(0)* 7 to 9 labelled a_1(1)* 8 to 2 labelled a_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled b_1(1)* 10 to 11 labelled a_1(1)* 11 to 12 labelled b_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled b_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled b_1(1)* 13 to 9 labelled a_1(1)* 14 to 2 labelled a_1(1)

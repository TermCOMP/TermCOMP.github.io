Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(b(x1)) -> x1
   a(c(c(x1))) -> c(c(b(a(c(a(x1))))))

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   b(a(x1)) -> x1
   c(c(a(x1))) -> a(c(a(b(c(c(x1))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C(c(a(x1))) -> A(c(a(b(c(c(x1))))))
   C(c(a(x1))) -> C(a(b(c(c(x1)))))
   C(c(a(x1))) -> A(b(c(c(x1))))

   a(x1) -> x1
   b(a(x1)) -> x1
   c(c(a(x1))) -> a(c(a(b(c(c(x1))))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 3 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

   C(c(a(x1))) -> C(a(b(c(c(x1)))))
   C(c(a(x1))) -> C(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   b(a(x1)) -> x1

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C(c(a(x1))) -> C(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(C(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [-I], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, 1A], [-I, -I, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [0A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[1A, 1A, 1A], [0A, 0A, 0A], [-I, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   c(c(a(x1))) -> a(c(a(b(c(c(x1))))))
   b(a(x1)) -> x1

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 ⟶ 1 ,
  1 1 2 ⟶ 0 2 2 2 0 1 }

  Possible projection steps are implicit:

2 1 1 1 1
    Applying rule 2 1 1 ⟶ 1 0 2 2 2 0 at position 0 results in
1 0 2 2 2 0 1 1
    Applying rule 0 ⟶ 1 at position 5 results in

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> b(b(c(x1)))
   a(b(b(c(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 4. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> b(b(c(x1)))
   a(b(b(c(x1)))) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 94, 95, 96, 97

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

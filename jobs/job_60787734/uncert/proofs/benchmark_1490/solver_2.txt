Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(a(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(b(a(x1))))
   B(a(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(a(x1)))
   B(a(a(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(b(a(x1))))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B(a(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(a(x1)))
   B(a(a(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))


----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(a(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(b(a(x1))))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(b(a(x1))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B(a(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(b(a(x1))))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(b(a(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 5*x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 3 + 5*x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.

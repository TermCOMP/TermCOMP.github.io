Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(b(x1))))
   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(a(b(a(x1))))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(b(x1))))
   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(a(b(b(x1))))
   B(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(b(b(x1)))
   B(a(b(a(x1)))) -> B(b(x1))
   B(a(b(a(x1)))) -> B(x1)
   A(b(a(b(x1)))) -> B(a(b(a(x1))))
   A(b(a(b(x1)))) -> A(b(a(x1)))
   A(b(a(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))
   A(b(a(b(x1)))) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(b(x1))))
   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(b(b(x1)))
   B(a(b(a(x1)))) -> B(b(x1))
   B(a(b(a(x1)))) -> B(x1)
   A(b(a(b(x1)))) -> B(a(x1))
   A(b(a(b(x1)))) -> A(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   b(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(b(x1))))

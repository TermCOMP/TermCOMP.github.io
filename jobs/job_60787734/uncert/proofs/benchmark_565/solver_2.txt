(11) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   0^1(5(2(5(x1)))) -> 0^1(5(3(2(5(x1)))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 1
   POL(0^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 1
   POL(2^1(x_1)) = 1
   POL(3(x_1)) = 0
   POL(4(x_1)) = 1
   POL(4^1(x_1)) = 1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5^1(x_1)) = 1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

(13) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   2^1(1(0(0(x1)))) -> 2^1(0(x1))
   5^1(0(1(4(5(x1))))) -> 4^1(x1)
   4^1(3(0(2(0(x1))))) -> 2^1(5(4(0(x1))))
   2^1(1(0(1(5(x1))))) -> 2^1(x1)
   2^1(0(3(1(3(x1))))) -> 2^1(x1)
   2^1(5(0(1(3(x1))))) -> 2^1(x1)
   2^1(0(5(1(3(x1))))) -> 5^1(2(x1))
   2^1(0(5(1(3(x1))))) -> 2^1(x1)
   2^1(0(1(3(4(x1))))) -> 2^1(4(x1))
   4^1(3(0(2(0(x1))))) -> 5^1(4(0(x1)))

   0^1(5(5(5(4(x1))))) -> 5^1(x1)
   0^1(2(5(1(5(x1))))) -> 2^1(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(0^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5^1(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   2^1(0(5(2(0(x1))))) -> 0^1(0(x1))
   0^1(5(5(2(0(x1))))) -> 2^1(0(0(x1)))

   0^1(5(5(2(0(x1))))) -> 0^1(0(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(0^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 1

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   0^1(1(3(5(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(30) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*0^1(1(3(5(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

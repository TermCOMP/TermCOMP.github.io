Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS
(1) NonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 391 ms]
(2) NO

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 0(1(0(1(x1))))
   1(0(0(1(x1)))) -> 0(0(1(0(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

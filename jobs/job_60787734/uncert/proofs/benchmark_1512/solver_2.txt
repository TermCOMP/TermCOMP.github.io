Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> b(a(b(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))

   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))

----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))
   B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{B_1}(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B_{B_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))

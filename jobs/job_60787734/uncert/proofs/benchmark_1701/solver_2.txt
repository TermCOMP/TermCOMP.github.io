(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))) -> b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(c(b(x1))))))) -> b(c(b(a(a(b(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 16 labelled b_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled c_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled b_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled c_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled b_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 38 labelled b_1(1)* 24 to 25 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 38 labelled b_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(0)* 25 to 38 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 26 to 38 labelled b_1(1)* 38 to 39 labelled c_1(1)* 39 to 40 labelled b_1(1)* 40 to 41 labelled a_1(1)* 41 to 42 labelled a_1(1)* 42 to 43 labelled b_1(1)* 43 to 44 labelled c_1(1)* 44 to 45 labelled b_1(1)* 45 to 46 labelled a_1(1)* 45 to 38 labelled b_1(1)* 46 to 47 labelled a_1(1)* 46 to 38 labelled b_1(1)* 47 to 48 labelled a_1(1)* 47 to 38 labelled b_1(1)* 48 to 4 labelled a_1(1)* 48 to 38 labelled b_1(1)

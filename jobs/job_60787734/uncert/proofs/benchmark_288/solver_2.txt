----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 0(1(0(1(x1))))
   1(0(1(0(x1)))) -> 0(1(0(0(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 1(0(1(0(x1))))
   0(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0(0(1(0(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   0^1(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 0^1(1(0(x1)))
   0^1(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0^1(0(1(0(x1))))
   0^1(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0^1(1(0(x1)))
   0^1(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 1(0(1(0(x1))))
   0(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0(0(1(0(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   0^1(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 0^1(1(0(x1)))
   0^1(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0^1(1(0(x1)))
   0^1(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(0^1(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 2 + x_1


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   0^1(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0^1(0(1(0(x1))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 1(0(1(0(x1))))
   0(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0(0(1(0(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   0^1(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0^1(0(1(0(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(0^1(x_1)) =  	[[-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(1(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[1A, 0A, 0A], [-I, -I, 0A], [-I, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(0(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, -I], [0A, 1A, 0A], [1A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   0(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 1(0(1(0(x1))))
   0(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0(0(1(0(x1))))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(0(0(0(x1)))) -> 1(0(1(0(x1))))
   0(1(0(1(x1)))) -> 0(0(1(0(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(b(x1)) -> B(a(a(a(x1))))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(a(a(x1)))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
   B(a(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   A(a(x1)) -> A(c(b(x1)))
   A(a(x1)) -> B(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(a(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(x1)) -> B(a(a(a(x1))))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(a(a(x1)))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
   A(a(x1)) -> B(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(b(x1)) -> B(a(a(a(x1))))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(a(a(x1)))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 0

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(a(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   A(a(x1)) -> B(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*A(a(x1)) -> B(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*B(a(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1


----------------------------------------

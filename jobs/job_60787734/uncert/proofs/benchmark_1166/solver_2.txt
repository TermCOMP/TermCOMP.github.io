Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS
(1) NonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 216 ms]
(2) NO

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(b(x1)) -> b(b(a(c(a(x1)))))
   b(x1) -> x1
   c(b(c(x1))) -> x1

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

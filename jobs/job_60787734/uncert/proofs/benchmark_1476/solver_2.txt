Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(x1)))) -> a(a(b(a(x1))))
   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(b(x1)))) -> a(a(b(a(x1))))
   a(a(a(b(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))
   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x0))))


----------------------------------------

(9) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{A_1}(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x0))))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{A_1}(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{A_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))


----------------------------------------

(12)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x0))))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(14)
YES

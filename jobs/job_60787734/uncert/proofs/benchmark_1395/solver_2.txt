----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(b(c(a(x1))))))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(x1)) -> A(b(a(b(c(a(x1))))))
   A(a(x1)) -> A(b(c(a(x1))))
   A(a(x1)) -> C(a(x1))
   C(b(x1)) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(b(c(a(x1))))))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(x1)) -> C(a(x1))
   C(b(x1)) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(b(c(a(x1))))))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*C(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*A(a(x1)) -> C(a(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1


----------------------------------------

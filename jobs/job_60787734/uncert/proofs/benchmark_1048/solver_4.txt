Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, c ↦ 1, b ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 2 ,
  2 2 2 ⟶ 1 1 1 ,
  1 1 1 ⟶ 0 2 2 }

Loop of length 19 starting with a source of size 7.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 0 0 2 2 2 2
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 2 at position 0 results in
1 1 2 2 2 2 2
    Applying rule 2 2 2 ⟶ 1 1 1 at position 2 results in
1 1 1 1 1 2 2
    Applying rule 1 1 1 ⟶ 0 2 2 at position 2 results in
1 1 0 2 2 2 2
    Applying rule 2 2 2 ⟶ 1 1 1 at position 3 results in
1 1 0 1 1 1 2
    Applying rule 1 1 1 ⟶ 0 2 2 at position 3 results in
1 1 0 0 2 2 2
    Applying rule 2 2 2 ⟶ 1 1 1 at position 4 results in
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
    Applying rule 1 1 1 ⟶ 0 2 2 at position 4 results in
1 1 0 0 0 2 2
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 2 at position 2 results in

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(2^1(x_1)) = x_1

   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

(11) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   2^1(5(0(4(2(x1))))) -> 2^1(4(0(x1)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 0
   POL(2(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(2^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = 0
   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   4(0(1(0(x1)))) -> 0(0(4(1(3(x1)))))
   4(0(1(0(x1)))) -> 1(3(0(0(4(3(x1))))))

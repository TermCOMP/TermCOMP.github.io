Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   R(b(x1)) -> b(R(x1))
   R(c(x1)) -> L(c(x1))
   b(L(x1)) -> L(b(x1))
   a(L(x1)) -> a(b(R(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"a (b)^k L c -> a (b)^k+1 L c"
a (b)^k L c -> a (b)^k+1 L c
by Overlap u with r (ol3)"a (b)^k L -> a (b)^k+1 R
by Equivalent"a (b)^k L -> a b (b)^k R
by Overlapping Derivationstructures"a (b)^k L -> a b R (b)^k

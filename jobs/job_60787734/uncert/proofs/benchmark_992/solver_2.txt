   c(b(x1)) -> a(a(c(x1)))
   d(d(x1)) -> d(b(d(b(d(x1)))))
   c(c(x1)) -> c(d(c(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(b(b(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(34) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C(c(x1)) -> C(d(c(x1)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(C(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(d(x_1)) = 0

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   d(d(x1)) -> d(b(d(b(d(x1)))))

Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
   c(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(a(c(x1)))))
   b(b(b(x1))) -> a(b(x1))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(a(c(x1)))
   d(d(x1)) -> d(b(d(b(d(x1)))))
   c(c(x1)) -> c(d(c(x1)))
   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(b(b(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(36) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.

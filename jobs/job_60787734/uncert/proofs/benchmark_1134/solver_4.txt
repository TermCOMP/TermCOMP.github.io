Remains to prove termination of a 4-rules system (4 strict rules).
Incorporating context-free projections into matching.
Remains to prove termination of a 3-rules system (3 strict rules).
Loop of length 7 starting with a source of size 4.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 2 1 ,
  1 ⟶ 0 ,
  2 2 ⟶ }

Loop of length 7 starting with a source of size 4.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 1 2 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 2 1 at position 0 results in
1 0 0 2 1 2 1
    Applying rule 1 ⟶ 0 at position 4 results in
1 0 0 2 0 2 1
    Applying rule 2 2 ⟶ at position 3 results in
1 0 0 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 2 1 at position 2 results in
1 0 1 0 0 2 1

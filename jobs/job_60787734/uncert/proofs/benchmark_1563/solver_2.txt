(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))) -> b(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))) -> b(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103

Node 12 is start node and node 13 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 12 to 14 labelled b_1(0)* 13 to 13 labelled #_1(0)* 14 to 15 labelled b_1(0)* 15 to 16 labelled a_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled a_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled b_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 95 labelled b_1(1)* 20 to 21 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 95 labelled b_1(1)* 21 to 22 labelled a_1(0)* 21 to 95 labelled b_1(1)* 22 to 13 labelled a_1(0)* 22 to 95 labelled b_1(1)* 95 to 96 labelled b_1(1)* 96 to 97 labelled a_1(1)* 97 to 98 labelled a_1(1)* 98 to 99 labelled b_1(1)* 99 to 100 labelled b_1(1)* 100 to 101 labelled a_1(1)* 100 to 95 labelled b_1(1)* 101 to 102 labelled a_1(1)* 101 to 95 labelled b_1(1)* 102 to 103 labelled a_1(1)* 102 to 95 labelled b_1(1)* 103 to 13 labelled a_1(1)* 103 to 95 labelled b_1(1)

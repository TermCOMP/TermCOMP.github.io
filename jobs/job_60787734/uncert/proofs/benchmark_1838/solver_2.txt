----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(n(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(r(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(t(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(u(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   r(r(x1)) -> r(s(x1))
   n(r(x1)) -> r(s(x1))

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(c(a(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(c(a(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(a(c(a(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(a(c(a(b(a(c(a(a(b(a(c(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(a(b(a(a(c(a(b(x1))))))))) -> c(a(b(a(a(c(a(b(a(c(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(c(a(b(a(a(c(a(b(x1))))))))) -> c(a(b(a(a(c(a(b(a(c(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
99, 100, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 149, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170, 172

Node 99 is start node and node 100 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 99 to 113 labelled c_1(0)* 100 to 100 labelled #_1(0)* 113 to 114 labelled a_1(0)* 114 to 115 labelled b_1(0)* 115 to 116 labelled a_1(0)* 116 to 117 labelled a_1(0)* 117 to 118 labelled c_1(0)* 118 to 119 labelled a_1(0)* 119 to 120 labelled b_1(0)* 120 to 121 labelled a_1(0)* 120 to 149 labelled c_1(1)* 121 to 122 labelled c_1(0)* 122 to 123 labelled a_1(0)* 123 to 124 labelled b_1(0)* 124 to 100 labelled a_1(0)* 124 to 149 labelled c_1(1)* 149 to 152 labelled a_1(1)* 152 to 154 labelled b_1(1)* 154 to 156 labelled a_1(1)* 156 to 158 labelled a_1(1)* 158 to 160 labelled c_1(1)* 160 to 162 labelled a_1(1)* 162 to 164 labelled b_1(1)* 164 to 166 labelled a_1(1)* 164 to 149 labelled c_1(1)* 166 to 168 labelled c_1(1)* 168 to 170 labelled a_1(1)* 170 to 172 labelled b_1(1)* 172 to 100 labelled a_1(1)* 172 to 149 labelled c_1(1)

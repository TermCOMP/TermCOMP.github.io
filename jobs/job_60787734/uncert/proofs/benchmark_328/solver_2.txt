Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1

(9) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*3^1(5(5(0(2(3(5(0(5(0(4(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 2^1(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*2^1(2(1(0(2(5(1(2(1(5(4(5(x1)))))))))))) -> 3^1(5(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*2^1(0(2(4(5(1(2(2(5(3(5(0(x1)))))))))))) -> 2^1(x1)

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(b(a(a(x1))))
   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> B(a(a(x1)))
   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(a(x1))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(b(a(b(x1))))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(b(x1)))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> A(b(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(b(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(b(a(a(x1))))
   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> B(a(a(x1)))
   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(a(x1))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(b(a(b(x1))))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> B(a(b(x1)))
   B(a(b(b(x1)))) -> A(b(x1))

Strictly oriented rules of the TRS R:

   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(b(x1))))

Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 2 + x_1


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

The problem is decomposed in 2 subproblems.

Problem 1.1: 

Reduction Pair Processor:
-> Pairs:
 A(b(a(a(x1)))) -> A(b(a(x1)))
-> Rules:
 a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> c(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
 a(c(b(x1))) -> a(a(b(c(b(a(x1))))))
-> Usable rules:
 a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> c(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
 a(c(b(x1))) -> a(a(b(c(b(a(x1))))))
->Interpretation type:
 Linear
->Coefficients:
 All rationals
->Dimension:
 1
->Bound:
 2
->Interpretation:
 
[a](X) = X + 1/2
[b](X) = 1/2.X
[c](X) = 1
[fSNonEmpty] = 0
[A](X) = 1/2.X

Problem 1.1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> c(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
 a(c(b(x1))) -> a(a(b(c(b(a(x1))))))
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Problem 1.2:

->Projection:
 pi(A) = 1

Problem 1.2: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> c(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
 a(c(b(x1))) -> a(a(b(c(b(a(x1))))))
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(x1)) -> a(b(x1))
   b(x1) -> a(a(x1))
   b(b(b(x1))) -> a(c(b(x1)))
   a(c(a(x1))) -> a(c(c(x1)))

Q is empty.

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(x1) -> a(a(x1))
   b(b(b(x1))) -> b(c(a(x1)))
   a(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 6. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   c(c(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(x1) -> a(a(x1))
   b(b(b(x1))) -> b(c(a(x1)))
   a(c(a(x1))) -> c(c(a(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 70, 71, 72, 73

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

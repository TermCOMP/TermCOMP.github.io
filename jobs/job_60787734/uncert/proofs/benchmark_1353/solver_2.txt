Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(x1)
   b(c(x1)) -> a(x1)
   c(b(x1)) -> a(b(c(c(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(x1)) -> B(x1)
   B(c(x1)) -> A(x1)
   C(b(x1)) -> A(b(c(c(x1))))
   C(b(x1)) -> B(c(c(x1)))
   C(b(x1)) -> C(c(x1))
   C(b(x1)) -> C(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(x1)
   b(c(x1)) -> a(x1)
   c(b(x1)) -> a(b(c(c(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 2 less nodes.

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(x1)) -> B(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> b(x1)
   b(c(x1)) -> a(x1)
   c(b(x1)) -> a(b(c(c(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(6) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

(8) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*A(a(x1)) -> B(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*B(c(x1)) -> A(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

(11) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C(b(x1)) -> C(c(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(C(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [-I], [1A]] 	 +  	[[1A, 1A, 1A], [0A, 0A, 0A], [1A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [-I], [0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, 0A], [0A, -I, -I], [0A, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, 1A, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A], [0A, 1A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   c(b(x1)) -> a(b(c(c(x1))))
   b(c(x1)) -> a(x1)
   a(a(x1)) -> b(x1)

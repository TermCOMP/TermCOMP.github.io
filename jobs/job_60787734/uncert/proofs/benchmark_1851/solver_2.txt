Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> c(b(x1))
   b(b(x1)) -> a(c(x1))
   c(c(x1)) -> b(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(x1)) -> c(b(x1))
   b(b(x1)) -> a(c(x1))
   c(c(x1)) -> b(a(x1))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 8 labelled c_1(0)* 1 to 9 labelled a_1(0)* 1 to 10 labelled b_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 8 to 2 labelled b_1(0)* 8 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 9 to 2 labelled c_1(0)* 9 to 15 labelled b_1(1)* 10 to 2 labelled a_1(0)* 10 to 16 labelled c_1(1)* 14 to 2 labelled c_1(1)* 14 to 15 labelled b_1(1)* 15 to 2 labelled a_1(1)* 15 to 16 labelled c_1(1)* 16 to 2 labelled b_1(1)* 16 to 14 labelled a_1(1)

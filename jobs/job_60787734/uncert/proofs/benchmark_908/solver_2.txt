Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(c(x1)) -> d(c(x1))
   b(d(x1)) -> d(b(x1))
   a(d(x1)) -> a(b(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"a (b)^k d c -> a (b)^k+1 d c"
a (b)^k d c -> a (b)^k+1 d c
by Overlap u with r (ol3)"a (b)^k d -> a (b)^k+1 b
by Operation expand"a (b)^k d -> a (b)^k+2
by Equivalent"a (b)^k d -> a b b (b)^k
by Overlap u with l (ol4)"(b)^k d -> d (b)^k
by Selfoverlapping OC am1"b d -> d b
by original rule (OC 1)"""a d -> a b b
by original rule (OC 1)"""""b c -> d c
by original rule (OC 1)"

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(c(x1))) -> c(b(a(x1)))
   a(c(x1)) -> a(a(d(a(x1))))
   d(a(b(x1))) -> b(a(d(x1)))
   d(a(c(x1))) -> b(c(c(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(b(b(a(x1))))
   a(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(b(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{B_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(17) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> A_{B_1}(x1)
   A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(x1)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(19) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> A_{B_1}(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

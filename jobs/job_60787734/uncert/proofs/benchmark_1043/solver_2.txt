(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(c(a(a(x1))))
   c(c(c(x1))) -> a(x1)
   a(x1) -> x1

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(c(a(a(x1))))
   a(c(c(c(x1)))) -> a(a(x1))
   c(c(c(c(x1)))) -> c(a(x1))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(x1)
   c(a(x1)) -> c(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))))
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)) -> a_{c_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> c_{a_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)) -> c_{c_1}(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   a_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)) -> a_{c_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> c_{a_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)) -> c_{c_1}(x1)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))))




----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(9) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

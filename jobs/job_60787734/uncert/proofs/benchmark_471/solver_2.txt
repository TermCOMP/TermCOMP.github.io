(20) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*5^1(4(0(1(0(x1))))) -> 5^1(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*5^1(4(1(1(x1)))) -> 5^1(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*5^1(1(0(0(1(x1))))) -> 5^1(x1)

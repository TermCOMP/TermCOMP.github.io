Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))
   b(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))
   b(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(b(b(b(a(b(x1))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(b(x1))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(x1))))))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))
   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(b(x1))))))))) -> b(a(b(b(b(b(x1))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))))))

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^3, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(B_{B_1}(x_1)) =  	[[1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0], [0]] 	 +  	[[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0], [0]] 	 +  	[[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(B_{A_1}(x_1)) =  	[[0]] 	 +  	[[0, 0, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<

>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 85, 86, 87, 89, 91, 93, 94, 96

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 13 labelled b_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 13 to 14 labelled a_1(0)* 14 to 15 labelled a_1(0)* 15 to 16 labelled b_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled a_1(0)* 16 to 85 labelled b_1(1)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 18 to 85 labelled b_1(1)* 19 to 20 labelled b_1(0)* 20 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 85 labelled b_1(1)* 85 to 86 labelled a_1(1)* 86 to 87 labelled a_1(1)* 87 to 89 labelled b_1(1)* 89 to 91 labelled a_1(1)* 89 to 85 labelled b_1(1)* 91 to 93 labelled b_1(1)* 93 to 94 labelled a_1(1)* 93 to 85 labelled b_1(1)* 94 to 96 labelled b_1(1)* 96 to 4 labelled a_1(1)* 96 to 85 labelled b_1(1)

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 3 labelled b_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 4 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled b_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled a_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled b_1(0)* 8 to 9 labelled a_1(0)* 8 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 9 to 10 labelled a_1(0)* 9 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 10 to 11 labelled a_1(0)* 10 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 11 to 12 labelled a_1(0)* 11 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled a_1(0)* 12 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled a_1(0)* 13 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 14 to 2 labelled a_1(0)* 14 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 77 to 78 labelled a_1(1)* 78 to 79 labelled a_1(1)* 79 to 80 labelled b_1(1)* 80 to 81 labelled a_1(1)* 81 to 82 labelled b_1(1)* 82 to 83 labelled a_1(1)* 82 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 83 to 84 labelled a_1(1)* 83 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 84 to 85 labelled a_1(1)* 84 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 85 to 86 labelled a_1(1)* 85 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 86 to 87 labelled a_1(1)* 86 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 87 to 88 labelled a_1(1)* 87 to 77 labelled b_1(1)* 88 to 2 labelled a_1(1)* 88 to 77 labelled b_1(1)

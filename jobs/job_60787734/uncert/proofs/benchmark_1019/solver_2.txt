Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(x1)) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(b(x1)) -> B(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))
   B(b(x1)) -> B(a(a(b(x1))))
   B(b(a(b(x1)))) -> B(a(b(b(x1))))
   B(b(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(x1))
   B(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> B(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))
   B(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> B(b(x1))
   B(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> B(a(a(b(b(x1)))))
   B(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> B(b(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(x1)) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 5 less nodes.

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> B(b(x1))
   B(b(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(x1)) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(6) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*B(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> B(b(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*B(b(a(b(x1)))) -> B(b(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


----------------------------------------

YES

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> B(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(x1)) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> B(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(B(x_1)) =  	[[1A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, -I, -I], [-I, 0A, 0A], [0A, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 1A, -I], [-I, -I, -I], [-I, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b(b(x1)) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(b(x1))))
   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))

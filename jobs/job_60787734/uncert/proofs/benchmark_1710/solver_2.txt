Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(x))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(x))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(a(b(a(b(a(x))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(x))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
48, 49, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193

Node 48 is start node and node 49 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 48 to 158 labelled a_1(0)* 49 to 49 labelled #_1(0)* 158 to 159 labelled b_1(0)* 159 to 160 labelled a_1(0)* 160 to 161 labelled b_1(0)* 161 to 162 labelled a_1(0)* 162 to 163 labelled a_1(0)* 163 to 164 labelled a_1(0)* 164 to 165 labelled b_1(0)* 164 to 176 labelled a_1(1)* 165 to 166 labelled a_1(0)* 166 to 49 labelled b_1(0)* 166 to 167 labelled a_1(1)* 167 to 168 labelled b_1(1)* 168 to 169 labelled a_1(1)* 169 to 170 labelled b_1(1)* 170 to 171 labelled a_1(1)* 171 to 172 labelled a_1(1)* 172 to 173 labelled a_1(1)* 173 to 174 labelled b_1(1)* 173 to 185 labelled a_1(2)* 174 to 175 labelled a_1(1)* 175 to 49 labelled b_1(1)* 175 to 167 labelled a_1(1)* 176 to 177 labelled b_1(1)* 177 to 178 labelled a_1(1)* 178 to 179 labelled b_1(1)* 179 to 180 labelled a_1(1)* 180 to 181 labelled a_1(1)* 181 to 182 labelled a_1(1)* 182 to 183 labelled b_1(1)* 182 to 185 labelled a_1(2)* 183 to 184 labelled a_1(1)* 184 to 171 labelled b_1(1)* 184 to 167 labelled a_1(1)* 185 to 186 labelled b_1(2)* 186 to 187 labelled a_1(2)* 187 to 188 labelled b_1(2)* 188 to 189 labelled a_1(2)* 189 to 190 labelled a_1(2)* 190 to 191 labelled a_1(2)* 191 to 192 labelled b_1(2)* 191 to 185 labelled a_1(2)* 192 to 193 labelled a_1(2)* 193 to 171 labelled b_1(2)* 193 to 167 labelled a_1(1)

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(l(x1)) -> l(a(x1))
   r(a(x1)) -> a(r(x1))
   b(l(x1)) -> b(a(r(x1)))
   r(b(x1)) -> l(b(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"b (a)^k l b -> b (a)^k+1 l b"
b (a)^k l b -> b (a)^k+1 l b
by Overlap u with r (ol3)"b (a)^k l -> b (a)^k+1 r
by Equivalent"b (a)^k l -> b a (a)^k r
by Overlapping Derivationstructures"b (a)^k l -> b a r (a)^k
by Overlap u with l (ol4)"(a)^k l -> l (a)^k
by Selfoverlapping OC am1"a l -> l a

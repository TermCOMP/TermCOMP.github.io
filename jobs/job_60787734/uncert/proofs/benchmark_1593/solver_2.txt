Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))) -> b(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))) -> b(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64

Node 43 is start node and node 44 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 43 to 45 labelled b_1(0)* 44 to 44 labelled #_1(0)* 45 to 46 labelled a_1(0)* 46 to 47 labelled a_1(0)* 47 to 48 labelled a_1(0)* 48 to 49 labelled a_1(0)* 49 to 50 labelled b_1(0)* 50 to 51 labelled a_1(0)* 50 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 51 to 52 labelled a_1(0)* 51 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 52 to 53 labelled a_1(0)* 52 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 53 to 54 labelled a_1(0)* 53 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 54 to 44 labelled a_1(0)* 54 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 55 to 56 labelled a_1(1)* 56 to 57 labelled a_1(1)* 57 to 58 labelled a_1(1)* 58 to 59 labelled a_1(1)* 59 to 60 labelled b_1(1)* 60 to 61 labelled a_1(1)* 60 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 61 to 62 labelled a_1(1)* 61 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 62 to 63 labelled a_1(1)* 62 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 63 to 64 labelled a_1(1)* 63 to 55 labelled b_1(1)* 64 to 44 labelled a_1(1)* 64 to 55 labelled b_1(1)

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(x)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(x))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(x)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(x))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(x)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(x))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 3 labelled a_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled b_1(0)* 4 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled b_1(0)* 5 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 6 to 7 labelled a_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled b_1(0)* 8 to 9 labelled b_1(0)* 8 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 9 to 10 labelled a_1(0)* 10 to 11 labelled b_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled b_1(0)* 11 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled a_1(0)* 13 to 2 labelled b_1(0)* 13 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 14 to 15 labelled b_1(1)* 15 to 16 labelled a_1(1)* 16 to 17 labelled b_1(1)* 16 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 17 to 18 labelled a_1(1)* 18 to 19 labelled b_1(1)* 19 to 20 labelled b_1(1)* 19 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 20 to 21 labelled a_1(1)* 21 to 22 labelled b_1(1)* 22 to 23 labelled b_1(1)* 22 to 14 labelled a_1(1)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(1)* 24 to 2 labelled b_1(1)* 24 to 14 labelled a_1(1)

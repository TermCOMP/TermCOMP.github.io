Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(c(x1)))
   a(c(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   c(a(x1)) -> b(a(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"b a (c)^k b a -> b a (c)^2k+1 b a a"
b a (c)^k b a -> b a (c)^2k+1 b a a

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))
   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(b(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem.

(25) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{B_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))

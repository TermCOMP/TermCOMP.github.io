Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   b(b(a(b(x1)))) -> a(a(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(b(b(b(x1))))
   a(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

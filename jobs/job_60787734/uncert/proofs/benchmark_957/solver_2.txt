(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(twice(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(twoto(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   twoto(0(x1)) -> p(p(s(s(s(p(p(p(s(s(s(0(p(p(s(s(x1))))))))))))))))

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1))))))))))
   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1)))))))))))))
   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1))))))))))))))))
   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1)))))))))))))))))))
   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1))))))))))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(3) QTRSRoofMatchBoundsTAProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R could be shown to be Match-Bounded [TAB_LEFTLINEAR,TAB_NONLEFTLINEAR] by  3. Therefore it terminates.

The compatible tree automaton used to show the Match-Boundedness is represented by: 
final states : [0, 1, 2]
transitions: 
10(0) -> 0
10(1) -> 0
10(2) -> 0
20(0) -> 1
20(1) -> 1
20(2) -> 1
00(0) -> 2
00(1) -> 2
00(2) -> 2
11(0) -> 10
21(10) -> 9
11(9) -> 8
11(8) -> 7
01(7) -> 6
11(6) -> 3
21(3) -> 5
01(5) -> 4
11(4) -> 3
21(3) -> 0
11(1) -> 10
11(2) -> 10
11(7) -> 10
11(5) -> 10
12(7) -> 18
22(18) -> 17
12(17) -> 16
12(16) -> 15
02(15) -> 14
12(14) -> 11
22(11) -> 13
02(13) -> 12
12(12) -> 11
22(11) -> 10
12(5) -> 18
12(15) -> 18
13(15) -> 26
23(26) -> 25
13(25) -> 24
13(24) -> 23
03(23) -> 22
13(22) -> 19
23(19) -> 21
03(21) -> 20
13(20) -> 19
23(19) -> 18
13(13) -> 26

13 -> 7
13 -> 18
21 -> 26

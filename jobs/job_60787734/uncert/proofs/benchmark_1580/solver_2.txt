Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 17 labelled b_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled a_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled b_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled a_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled b_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled a_1(0)* 22 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 24 to 25 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(0)* 25 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 27 labelled a_1(0)* 26 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 27 to 28 labelled a_1(0)* 27 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 28 to 2 labelled a_1(0)* 28 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 125 to 126 labelled a_1(1)* 126 to 127 labelled b_1(1)* 127 to 128 labelled a_1(1)* 128 to 129 labelled a_1(1)* 129 to 130 labelled b_1(1)* 130 to 131 labelled a_1(1)* 130 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 131 to 132 labelled a_1(1)* 131 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 132 to 133 labelled a_1(1)* 132 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 133 to 134 labelled a_1(1)* 133 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 134 to 135 labelled a_1(1)* 134 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 135 to 136 labelled a_1(1)* 135 to 125 labelled b_1(1)* 136 to 2 labelled a_1(1)* 136 to 125 labelled b_1(1)

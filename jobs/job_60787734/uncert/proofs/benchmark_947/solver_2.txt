(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(c(x1))) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   a(b(c(x1))) -> b(c(b(c(x1))))
   a(b(c(x1))) -> c(b(c(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(b(a(x1))) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   c(b(a(x1))) -> c(b(c(b(x1))))
   c(b(a(x1))) -> a(c(b(c(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(b(a(x1))) -> c(b(c(b(x1))))
   c(c(b(a(x1)))) -> c(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(c(b(a(x1)))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))

   a(c(b(a(x1)))) -> a(a(c(b(c(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1))) -> c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))))
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))
   c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))))
   c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))))
   c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))))

   B_{C_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> C_{B_1}(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B_{C_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(C_{B_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(C_{C_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

(19) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> C_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( C_{B_1}_1(x_1) ) = max{0, 2x_1 - 2}
POL( b_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1
POL( a_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1 + 2

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:
none

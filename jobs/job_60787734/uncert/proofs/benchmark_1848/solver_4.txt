Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, c ↦ 1, a ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 2 ,
  0 0 ⟶ 2 1 ,
  2 ⟶ 1 0 ,
  1 1 1 ⟶ 0 }

Removing 2 rules by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 5 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 2 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 7 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 1 ⟶ 2 ,
  2 ⟶ 1 0 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 2 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 2 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection { 2 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 0 ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 ⟶ 1 2 }

Removing 1 rule by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

2 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 1 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)

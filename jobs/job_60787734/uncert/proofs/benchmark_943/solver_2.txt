Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(x1)) -> a(a(a(b(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(b(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(b(b(b(b(x1))))))))
   b(b(c(c(x1)))) -> c(c(c(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(b(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(b(b(b(b(x1))))))))
   c(c(c(x1))) -> c(a(a(a(b(b(b(x1)))))))

   b(b(b(c(c(x1))))) -> b(c(c(c(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1))) -> c_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))))))

   b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))))))

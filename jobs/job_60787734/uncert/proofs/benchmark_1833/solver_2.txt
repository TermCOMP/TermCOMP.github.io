(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b(a(x1)) -> C(x1)
   c(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
   a(c(x1)) -> B(x1)
   C(A(x1)) -> b(x1)
   B(C(x1)) -> a(x1)
   A(B(x1)) -> c(x1)
   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> A(A(A(x1)))
   A(A(A(A(x1)))) -> a(a(a(x1)))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> B(B(B(x1)))
   B(B(B(B(x1)))) -> b(b(b(x1)))
   c(c(c(c(x1)))) -> C(C(C(x1)))
   C(C(C(C(x1)))) -> c(c(c(x1)))
   A(a(x1)) -> x1
   a(A(x1)) -> x1
   B(b(x1)) -> x1

The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.

   b(b(b(C(x1)))) -> B(B(B(a(x1))))

   c(B(B(B(x0))))

(7) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A^1(a(a(B(x1)))) -> C^1(x1)
   B^1(A(A(A(x1)))) -> A^1(a(a(x1)))
   B^1(A(A(A(x1)))) -> A^1(a(x1))
   B^1(A(A(A(x1)))) -> A^1(x1)

   C^1(B(B(B(x1)))) -> B^1(b(b(x1)))
   C^1(B(B(B(x1)))) -> B^1(b(x1))
   C^1(B(B(B(x1)))) -> B^1(x1)
   C^1(c(c(A(x1)))) -> B^1(x1)
   A^1(C(C(C(x1)))) -> C^1(c(c(x1)))
   A^1(C(C(C(x1)))) -> C^1(c(x1))
   A^1(C(C(C(x1)))) -> C^1(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(B(x1)))) -> A(A(A(c(x1))))
   b(A(A(A(x1)))) -> C(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(C(x1)))) -> B(B(B(a(x1))))
   c(B(B(B(x1)))) -> A(b(b(b(x1))))
   c(c(c(A(x1)))) -> C(C(C(b(x1))))
   a(C(C(C(x1)))) -> B(c(c(c(x1))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a(a(a(B(x0))))
   b(A(A(A(x0))))
   b(b(b(C(x0))))
   c(B(B(B(x0))))
   c(c(c(A(x0))))
   a(C(C(C(x0))))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A^1(a(a(B(x1)))) -> C^1(x1)
   B^1(A(A(A(x1)))) -> A^1(a(a(x1)))
   B^1(A(A(A(x1)))) -> A^1(a(x1))
   B^1(A(A(A(x1)))) -> A^1(x1)
   B^1(b(b(C(x1)))) -> A^1(x1)
   C^1(B(B(B(x1)))) -> B^1(b(x1))
   C^1(B(B(B(x1)))) -> B^1(x1)
   C^1(c(c(A(x1)))) -> B^1(x1)
   A^1(C(C(C(x1)))) -> C^1(c(c(x1)))
   A^1(C(C(C(x1)))) -> C^1(c(x1))
   A^1(C(C(C(x1)))) -> C^1(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(A^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(C^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(a(a(B(x1)))) -> A(A(A(c(x1))))
   a(C(C(C(x1)))) -> B(c(c(c(x1))))
   b(A(A(A(x1)))) -> C(a(a(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(C(x1)))) -> B(B(B(a(x1))))
   c(B(B(B(x1)))) -> A(b(b(b(x1))))
   c(c(c(A(x1)))) -> C(C(C(b(x1))))

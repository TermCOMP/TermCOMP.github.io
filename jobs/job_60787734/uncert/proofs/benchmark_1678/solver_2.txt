Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))) -> b(b(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))) -> b(b(a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52

Node 15 is start node and node 16 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 15 to 17 labelled b_1(0)* 16 to 16 labelled #_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled b_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled b_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled a_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled b_1(0)* 24 to 25 labelled b_1(0)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(0)* 25 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 27 labelled a_1(0)* 26 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 27 to 28 labelled a_1(0)* 27 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 28 to 16 labelled a_1(0)* 28 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 33 to 35 labelled b_1(1)* 35 to 37 labelled a_1(1)* 37 to 39 labelled b_1(1)* 39 to 41 labelled b_1(1)* 41 to 43 labelled a_1(1)* 43 to 45 labelled a_1(1)* 45 to 47 labelled b_1(1)* 47 to 49 labelled b_1(1)* 49 to 50 labelled a_1(1)* 49 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 50 to 51 labelled a_1(1)* 50 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 51 to 52 labelled a_1(1)* 51 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 52 to 16 labelled a_1(1)* 52 to 33 labelled b_1(1)

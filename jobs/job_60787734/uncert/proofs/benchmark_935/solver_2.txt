Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(d(x1)) -> d(b(c(b(d(x1)))))
   a(x1) -> b(b(f(b(b(x1)))))
   b(d(b(x1))) -> a(d(x1))
   d(f(x1)) -> b(d(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 4. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(d(x1)) -> d(b(c(b(d(x1)))))
   a(x1) -> b(b(f(b(b(x1)))))
   b(d(b(x1))) -> a(d(x1))
   d(f(x1)) -> b(d(x1))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 132, 133, 134, 135, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

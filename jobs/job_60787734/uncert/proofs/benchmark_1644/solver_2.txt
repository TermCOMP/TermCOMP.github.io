(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1)))))))) -> a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1)))))))) -> a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(b(a(x1))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(a(x1))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 15 labelled b_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 15 to 16 labelled a_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled a_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled b_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled a_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled b_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled a_1(0)* 22 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 23 to 24 labelled b_1(0)* 24 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 115 to 116 labelled a_1(1)* 116 to 117 labelled a_1(1)* 117 to 118 labelled b_1(1)* 118 to 119 labelled a_1(1)* 119 to 120 labelled b_1(1)* 120 to 121 labelled a_1(1)* 121 to 122 labelled b_1(1)* 122 to 123 labelled a_1(1)* 122 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 123 to 124 labelled b_1(1)* 124 to 4 labelled a_1(1)* 124 to 115 labelled b_1(1)

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220

Node 201 is start node and node 202 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 201 to 203 labelled b_1(0)* 202 to 202 labelled #_1(0)* 203 to 204 labelled a_1(0)* 204 to 205 labelled b_1(0)* 205 to 206 labelled a_1(0)* 206 to 207 labelled b_1(0)* 207 to 208 labelled a_1(0)* 207 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 208 to 209 labelled a_1(0)* 208 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 209 to 210 labelled a_1(0)* 209 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 210 to 211 labelled a_1(0)* 210 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 211 to 202 labelled a_1(0)* 211 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 212 to 213 labelled a_1(1)* 213 to 214 labelled b_1(1)* 214 to 215 labelled a_1(1)* 215 to 216 labelled b_1(1)* 216 to 217 labelled a_1(1)* 216 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 217 to 218 labelled a_1(1)* 217 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 218 to 219 labelled a_1(1)* 218 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 219 to 220 labelled a_1(1)* 219 to 212 labelled b_1(1)* 220 to 202 labelled a_1(1)* 220 to 212 labelled b_1(1)

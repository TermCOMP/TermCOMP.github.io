Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))) -> b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184

Node 87 is start node and node 88 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

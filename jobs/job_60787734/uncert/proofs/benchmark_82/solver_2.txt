Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   A(a(x1)) -> A(A(x1))
   A(b(x1)) -> AB(x1)
   AB(a(x1)) -> ABA(x1)
   AB(b(x1)) -> AB(B(x1))
   ABA(a(x1)) -> ABA(A(x1))
   ABA(b(x1)) -> ABAB(x1)
   ABAB(a(x1)) -> ABAB(A(x1))
   ABAB(b(x1)) -> ABABB(x1)
   ABABB(a(x1)) -> ABABB(A(x1))
   ABABB(b(x1)) -> ABABBB(x1)
   ABABBB(a(x1)) -> ABABBBA(x1)
   ABABBB(b(x1)) -> ABABBB(B(x1))
   ABABBBA(a(x1)) -> ABABBBA(A(x1))
   ABABBBA(b(x1)) -> ABABBBAB(x1)
   ABABBBAB(a(x1)) -> ABABBBABA(x1)
   ABABBBAB(b(x1)) -> ABABBBAB(B(x1))
   ABABBBABA(a(x1)) -> ABABBBABAA(x1)
   ABABBBABA(b(x1)) -> ABABBBABA(B(x1))
   ABABBBABAA(x1) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   B(a(x1)) -> BA(x1)
   B(b(x1)) -> B(B(x1))
   BA(a(x1)) -> BA(A(x1))
   BA(b(x1)) -> BAB(x1)
   BAB(a(x1)) -> BABA(x1)
   BAB(b(x1)) -> BAB(B(x1))
   BABA(x1) -> a(b(a(b(b(b(a(b(a(a(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232

Node 207 is start node and node 208 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 207 to 209 labelled b_1(0)* 208 to 208 labelled #_1(0)* 209 to 210 labelled a_1(0)* 210 to 211 labelled a_1(0)* 211 to 212 labelled a_1(0)* 212 to 213 labelled b_1(0)* 213 to 214 labelled a_1(0)* 214 to 215 labelled a_1(0)* 215 to 216 labelled a_1(0)* 216 to 217 labelled b_1(0)* 217 to 218 labelled a_1(0)* 217 to 221 labelled b_1(1)* 218 to 219 labelled a_1(0)* 218 to 221 labelled b_1(1)* 219 to 220 labelled a_1(0)* 219 to 221 labelled b_1(1)* 220 to 208 labelled a_1(0)* 220 to 221 labelled b_1(1)* 221 to 222 labelled a_1(1)* 222 to 223 labelled a_1(1)* 223 to 224 labelled a_1(1)* 224 to 225 labelled b_1(1)* 225 to 226 labelled a_1(1)* 226 to 227 labelled a_1(1)* 227 to 228 labelled a_1(1)* 228 to 229 labelled b_1(1)* 229 to 230 labelled a_1(1)* 229 to 221 labelled b_1(1)* 230 to 231 labelled a_1(1)* 230 to 221 labelled b_1(1)* 231 to 232 labelled a_1(1)* 231 to 221 labelled b_1(1)* 232 to 208 labelled a_1(1)* 232 to 221 labelled b_1(1)

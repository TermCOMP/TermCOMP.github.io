(8) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B(b(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> B(b(x1))
   B(b(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> B(b(b(x1)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(B(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, -I], [0A, 0A, -I], [0A, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(x1)

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(a(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 3 to 7 labelled b_1(0)* 3 to 16 labelled b_1(1)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 4 labelled b_1(0)* 5 to 18 labelled a_1(1)* 5 to 19 labelled b_1(2)* 7 to 8 labelled c_1(0)* 8 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 8 to 16 labelled b_1(1)* 16 to 17 labelled c_1(1)* 17 to 4 labelled a_1(1)* 17 to 16 labelled b_1(1)* 17 to 19 labelled a_1(1)* 18 to 4 labelled b_1(1)* 18 to 18 labelled a_1(1)* 18 to 19 labelled b_1(2)* 19 to 20 labelled c_1(2)* 20 to 4 labelled a_1(2)* 20 to 16 labelled b_1(1)* 20 to 19 labelled a_1(2)

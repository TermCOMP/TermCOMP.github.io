Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = 23 + x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = 26 + x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 18 + x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = 26 + x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = 12 + x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   2(2(4(4(5(3(0(3(4(1(3(4(3(2(5(1(x1)))))))))))))))) -> 2(0(1(2(0(1(5(2(0(4(2(2(4(5(0(0(x1))))))))))))))))

(9) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

   4^1(0(4(1(4(5(5(5(5(3(1(4(3(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))))))) -> 4^1(0(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   4(0(4(1(4(5(5(5(5(3(1(4(3(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))))))) -> 4(5(3(4(0(2(3(1(4(5(5(5(1(4(4(0(x1))))))))))))))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   4(0(4(1(4(5(5(5(5(3(1(4(3(4(2(0(x0))))))))))))))))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   4(0(4(1(4(5(5(5(5(3(1(4(3(4(2(0(x0))))))))))))))))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(15) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*4^1(0(4(1(4(5(5(5(5(3(1(4(3(4(2(0(x1)))))))))))))))) -> 4^1(0(x1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

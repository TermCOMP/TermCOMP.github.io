Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 0 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 0 0 0 1 0 ⟶ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 }

Removing 1 relatively right barren rule [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, WST 2022].
  The certifying automaton has 1 epsilon transition:
  { (0,0,2) ⟶ (0,0,0) }
After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)
{ }

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 0 ⟶ ,
  0 1 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 1 1 0 0 }

Applying the dependency pairs transformation [Arts, CAAP 1996], [Arts/Giesl, RTA 1996].
  Here, ↑ marks so-called defined symbols.
After renaming modulo the bijection { (0,↑) ↦ 0, (1,↓) ↦ 1, (0,↓) ↦ 2 },

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(c(c(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(c(c(a(a(b(c(c(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(c(c(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(c(c(a(a(b(c(c(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(c(c(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(c(a(a(b(c(c(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(c(c(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(c(c(a(a(b(c(c(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(c(c(b(x1))))))) -> c(c(b(a(a(c(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(c(c(b(x1))))))) -> c(c(b(a(a(c(c(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191

Node 168 is start node and node 169 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 168 to 170 labelled c_1(0)* 169 to 169 labelled #_1(0)* 170 to 171 labelled c_1(0)* 171 to 172 labelled b_1(0)* 172 to 173 labelled a_1(0)* 173 to 174 labelled a_1(0)* 174 to 175 labelled c_1(0)* 175 to 176 labelled c_1(0)* 176 to 177 labelled b_1(0)* 177 to 178 labelled a_1(0)* 177 to 181 labelled c_1(1)* 178 to 179 labelled a_1(0)* 178 to 181 labelled c_1(1)* 179 to 180 labelled a_1(0)* 179 to 181 labelled c_1(1)* 180 to 169 labelled a_1(0)* 180 to 181 labelled c_1(1)* 181 to 182 labelled c_1(1)* 182 to 183 labelled b_1(1)* 183 to 184 labelled a_1(1)* 184 to 185 labelled a_1(1)* 185 to 186 labelled c_1(1)* 186 to 187 labelled c_1(1)* 187 to 188 labelled b_1(1)* 188 to 189 labelled a_1(1)* 188 to 181 labelled c_1(1)* 189 to 190 labelled a_1(1)* 189 to 181 labelled c_1(1)* 190 to 191 labelled a_1(1)* 190 to 181 labelled c_1(1)* 191 to 169 labelled a_1(1)* 191 to 181 labelled c_1(1)

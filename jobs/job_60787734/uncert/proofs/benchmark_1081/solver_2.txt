Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(x1)) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(x1)
   b(a(x1)) -> b(x1)
   a(a(a(x1))) -> a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> b(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
   a(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> a(a(x1))
   b(b(b(b(b(x1))))) -> b(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> a_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> b_{a_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{b_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))

   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> a_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> b_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))

(9) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(12)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( B_{A_1}_1(x_1) ) = max{0, x_1 - 2}
POL( a_{b_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1 + 2
POL( b_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = max{0, x_1 - 1}
POL( a_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1 + 2
POL( b_{b_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1 + 1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{b_1}(x1)

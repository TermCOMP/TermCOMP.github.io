----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(a(x1)))
   b(x1) -> c(x1)
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b(x1) -> c(x1)




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(a(x1)))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(b(x1)) -> C(a(x1))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
   C(b(x1)) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(a(x1)))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(b(x1)) -> C(a(x1))
   A(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
   C(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 3 + 2*x_1
   POL(C(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(a(x1)))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(x1)
   a(b(x1)) -> b(c(a(x1)))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

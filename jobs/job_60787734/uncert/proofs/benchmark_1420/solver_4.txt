Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 4-rules system (4 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 0 0 ⟶ 1 ,
  1 2 ⟶ 0 2 2 1 ,
  2 ⟶ }

  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 0 0 2 2 2 2
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 at position 0 results in
1 2 2 2 2
    Applying rule 1 2 ⟶ 0 2 2 1 at position 0 results in
0 2 2 1 2 2 2
    Applying rule 1 2 ⟶ 0 2 2 1 at position 1 results in
0 0 2 2 1 2 2
    Applying rule 1 2 ⟶ 0 2 2 1 at position 2 results in
0 0 0 2 2 1 2
    Applying rule 1 2 ⟶ 0 2 2 1 at position 5 results in
0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 1

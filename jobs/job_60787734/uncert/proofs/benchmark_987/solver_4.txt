Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 ,
  0 2 ⟶ 1 }

Loop of length 12 starting with a source of size 7.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 0 1 0 1 2 1
    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 at position 0 results in
1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1
    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 at position 5 results in
1 2 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 2 1
    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 at position 3 results in
1 2 1 1 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1
    Applying rule 0 2 ⟶ 1 at position 8 results in
1 2 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 1
    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 at position 6 results in

    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 at position 10 results in
1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1
    Applying rule 0 2 ⟶ 1 at position 18 results in

    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 at position 16 results in

    Applying rule 0 2 ⟶ 1 at position 19 results in

    Applying rule 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 2 1 0 0 0 at position 25 results in

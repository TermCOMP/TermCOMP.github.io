Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(x1))) -> a(a(b(b(a(a(x1))))))
   b(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(a(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))
   A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 5 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

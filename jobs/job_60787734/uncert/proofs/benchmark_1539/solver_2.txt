(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
93, 94, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124

Node 93 is start node and node 94 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 93 to 105 labelled b_1(0)* 94 to 94 labelled #_1(0)* 105 to 106 labelled a_1(0)* 106 to 107 labelled a_1(0)* 107 to 108 labelled a_1(0)* 108 to 109 labelled b_1(0)* 109 to 110 labelled a_1(0)* 109 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 110 to 111 labelled a_1(0)* 110 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 111 to 112 labelled a_1(0)* 111 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 112 to 113 labelled a_1(0)* 112 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 113 to 114 labelled a_1(0)* 113 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 114 to 94 labelled a_1(0)* 114 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 115 to 116 labelled a_1(1)* 116 to 117 labelled a_1(1)* 117 to 118 labelled a_1(1)* 118 to 119 labelled b_1(1)* 119 to 120 labelled a_1(1)* 119 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 120 to 121 labelled a_1(1)* 120 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 121 to 122 labelled a_1(1)* 121 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 122 to 123 labelled a_1(1)* 122 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 123 to 124 labelled a_1(1)* 123 to 115 labelled b_1(1)* 124 to 94 labelled a_1(1)* 124 to 115 labelled b_1(1)

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1))))))))))
   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1))))))))))
   0(1(2(1(x1)))) -> 1(2(1(1(0(1(2(0(1(2(0(1(2(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172

Proof Outline:

Remains to prove termination of a 2-rules system (2 strict rules).
Loop of length 10 starting with a source of size 7.

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 2-rules system (2 strict rules)
{ 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 ,
  1 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 }

Loop of length 10 starting with a source of size 7.
  Possible projection steps are implicit:

1 1 0 0 1 0 0
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 at position 0 results in
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 at position 2 results in
0 1 1 1 1 0 0
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 at position 1 results in
0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 at position 4 results in
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 at position 6 results in
0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 at position 5 results in
0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 at position 3 results in
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 at position 2 results in
0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
    Applying rule 0 0 0 ⟶ 1 1 at position 0 results in
1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
    Applying rule 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 0 at position 4 results in
1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1

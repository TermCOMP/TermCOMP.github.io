Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x)))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(b(a(b(a(a(x))))))) -> a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(x)))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34

Node 1 is start node and node 3 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 3 to 3 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled a_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled b_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled a_1(0)* 8 to 9 labelled a_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled a_1(0)* 10 to 11 labelled b_1(0)* 10 to 25 labelled a_1(1)* 11 to 12 labelled a_1(0)* 12 to 13 labelled b_1(0)* 12 to 25 labelled a_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled a_1(0)* 14 to 3 labelled b_1(0)* 14 to 25 labelled a_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(1)* 26 to 27 labelled b_1(1)* 27 to 28 labelled a_1(1)* 28 to 29 labelled a_1(1)* 29 to 30 labelled a_1(1)* 30 to 31 labelled b_1(1)* 30 to 25 labelled a_1(1)* 31 to 32 labelled a_1(1)* 32 to 33 labelled b_1(1)* 32 to 25 labelled a_1(1)* 33 to 34 labelled a_1(1)* 34 to 3 labelled b_1(1)* 34 to 25 labelled a_1(1)

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> d(c(x1))
   a(b(x1)) -> c(c(c(x1)))
   b(b(x1)) -> a(c(c(x1)))
   c(c(x1)) -> b(x1)
   c(d(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   d(d(x1)) -> b(a(c(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> c(d(x1))
   b(a(x1)) -> c(c(c(x1)))
   b(b(x1)) -> c(c(a(x1)))
   c(c(x1)) -> b(x1)
   d(c(x1)) -> a(a(x1))
   d(d(x1)) -> c(a(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = 15 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 17 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 9 + x_1
   POL(d(x_1)) = 21 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b(a(x1)) -> c(c(c(x1)))
   b(b(x1)) -> c(c(a(x1)))
   c(c(x1)) -> b(x1)
   d(d(x1)) -> c(a(b(x1)))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> c(d(x1))
   d(c(x1)) -> a(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(x1)) -> D(x1)
   D(c(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   D(c(x1)) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> c(d(x1))
   d(c(x1)) -> a(a(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   A(a(x1)) -> D(x1)
   D(c(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   D(c(x1)) -> A(x1)

Strictly oriented rules of the TRS R:

   a(a(x1)) -> c(d(x1))
   d(c(x1)) -> a(a(x1))

Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(D(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(d(x_1)) = 2*x_1


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

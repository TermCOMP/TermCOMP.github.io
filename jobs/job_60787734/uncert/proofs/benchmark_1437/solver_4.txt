Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { b ↦ 0, a ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 1 1 1 ⟶ 0 0 1 1 ,
  1 0 1 1 ⟶ 0 0 0 1 ,
  0 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 0 }

Inverting the length-preserving system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 0 1 1 ⟶ 0 1 1 1 ,
  0 0 0 1 ⟶ 1 0 1 1 ,
  1 1 1 0 ⟶ 0 0 0 1 }

Removing 3 rules by a matrix interpretation [Hofbauer/Waldmann, RTA 2006]
  of type E_J with J = {1,...,2} and dimension 2:

0 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 2 1 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

1 ↦ ⎛     ⎞
    ⎜ 2 0 ⎟
    ⎜ 0 1 ⎟
    ⎝     ⎠

After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)
{ }

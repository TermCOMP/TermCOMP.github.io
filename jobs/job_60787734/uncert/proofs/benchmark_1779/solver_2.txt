Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   b(x1) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   b(x1) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   b(x1) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(a(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 11 labelled a_1(0)* 3 to 13 labelled c_1(0)* 3 to 15 labelled a_1(0)* 3 to 87 labelled a_1(1)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled a_1(0)* 11 to 95 labelled a_1(1)* 12 to 4 labelled b_1(0)* 12 to 85 labelled c_1(1)* 12 to 89 labelled a_1(1)* 12 to 99 labelled a_1(2)* 13 to 14 labelled a_1(0)* 14 to 4 labelled c_1(0)* 15 to 16 labelled c_1(0)* 16 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 16 to 91 labelled a_1(1)* 85 to 86 labelled a_1(1)* 86 to 4 labelled c_1(1)* 87 to 88 labelled c_1(1)* 88 to 12 labelled a_1(1)* 88 to 97 labelled a_1(2)* 88 to 95 labelled a_1(1)* 89 to 90 labelled a_1(1)* 89 to 97 labelled a_1(2)* 90 to 4 labelled b_1(1)* 90 to 93 labelled c_1(2)* 90 to 89 labelled a_1(1)* 90 to 99 labelled a_1(2)* 91 to 92 labelled c_1(1)* 92 to 4 labelled a_1(1)* 92 to 91 labelled a_1(1)* 93 to 94 labelled a_1(2)* 94 to 4 labelled c_1(2)* 95 to 96 labelled c_1(1)* 96 to 89 labelled a_1(1)* 96 to 99 labelled a_1(1), a_1(2)* 97 to 98 labelled c_1(2)* 98 to 89 labelled a_1(2)* 98 to 99 labelled a_1(2)* 98 to 101 labelled a_1(3)* 99 to 100 labelled c_1(2)* 100 to 90 labelled a_1(2)* 100 to 97 labelled a_1(2)* 100 to 103 labelled a_1(3)* 101 to 102 labelled c_1(3)* 102 to 97 labelled a_1(3)* 103 to 104 labelled c_1(3)* 104 to 99 labelled a_1(3)

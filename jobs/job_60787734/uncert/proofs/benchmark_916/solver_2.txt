Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(c(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 5. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(b(a(x1)))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> a(c(a(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 57, 58

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { c ↦ 0, a ↦ 1, b ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 2 1 2 ⟶ 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 0 1 2 0 1 }

{ 0 1 0 1 2 ⟶ 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 }

Removing 1 relatively RFC-match-bounded rule [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, WST 2022]
  (bounded by 1 for B = 5). The certifying automaton has 3 epsilon transitions:
  { (0,0,8) ⟶ (1,0,0), (0,0,11) ⟶ (0,0,0), (1,0,13) ⟶ (0,0,2) }
After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)

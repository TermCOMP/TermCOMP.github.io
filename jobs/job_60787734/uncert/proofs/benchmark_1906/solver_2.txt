Q is empty.

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))))

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{A_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B_{A_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))

(14) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(B_{A_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 0

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))) -> A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))))

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{A_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 0

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

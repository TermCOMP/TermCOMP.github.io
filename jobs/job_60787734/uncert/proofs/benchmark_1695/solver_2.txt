Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(b(c(a(b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(a(b(b(c(a(b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(b(c(a(b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(b(c(a(b(b(c(a(a(b(b(c(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(b(b(a(a(c(b(b(x1))))))))) -> c(b(b(a(a(c(b(b(a(c(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(c(b(b(a(a(c(b(b(x1))))))))) -> c(b(b(a(a(c(b(b(a(c(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 17 labelled c_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled b_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled a_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled c_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled b_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled b_1(0)* 24 to 25 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 161 labelled c_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled c_1(0)* 26 to 27 labelled b_1(0)* 27 to 28 labelled b_1(0)* 28 to 4 labelled a_1(0)* 28 to 161 labelled c_1(1)* 161 to 162 labelled b_1(1)* 162 to 163 labelled b_1(1)* 163 to 164 labelled a_1(1)* 164 to 165 labelled a_1(1)* 165 to 166 labelled c_1(1)* 166 to 167 labelled b_1(1)* 167 to 168 labelled b_1(1)* 168 to 169 labelled a_1(1)* 168 to 161 labelled c_1(1)* 169 to 170 labelled c_1(1)* 170 to 171 labelled b_1(1)* 171 to 172 labelled b_1(1)* 172 to 4 labelled a_1(1)* 172 to 161 labelled c_1(1)

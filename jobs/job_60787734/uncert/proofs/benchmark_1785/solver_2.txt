Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(b(x1))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 26, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 42, 43, 49, 50, 51, 52, 69, 70, 71, 72

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 10 labelled b_1(0)* 1 to 13 labelled a_1(0)* 1 to 36 labelled a_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 10 to 11 labelled b_1(0)* 10 to 26 labelled a_1(1)* 11 to 12 labelled a_1(0)* 11 to 31 labelled b_1(1)* 11 to 49 labelled a_1(2)* 12 to 2 labelled a_1(0)* 12 to 31 labelled b_1(1)* 12 to 49 labelled a_1(2)* 13 to 14 labelled c_1(0)* 14 to 2 labelled b_1(0)* 14 to 34 labelled a_1(1)* 26 to 27 labelled c_1(1)* 27 to 12 labelled b_1(1)* 27 to 34 labelled a_1(1)* 27 to 49 labelled b_1(1)* 27 to 69 labelled a_1(2)* 31 to 32 labelled b_1(1)* 31 to 42 labelled a_1(2)* 31 to 69 labelled a_1(2)* 32 to 33 labelled a_1(1)* 32 to 31 labelled b_1(1)* 32 to 49 labelled a_1(2)* 33 to 2 labelled a_1(1)* 33 to 31 labelled b_1(1)* 33 to 49 labelled a_1(2)* 34 to 35 labelled c_1(1)* 35 to 2 labelled b_1(1)* 35 to 34 labelled a_1(1)* 36 to 37 labelled c_1(1)* 37 to 26 labelled b_1(1)* 42 to 43 labelled c_1(2)* 43 to 33 labelled b_1(2)* 43 to 51 labelled a_1(2)* 43 to 71 labelled a_1(3)* 49 to 50 labelled c_1(2)* 50 to 42 labelled b_1(2)* 50 to 69 labelled b_1(2)* 51 to 52 labelled c_1(2)* 52 to 2 labelled b_1(2)* 52 to 34 labelled a_1(1)* 69 to 70 labelled c_1(2)* 70 to 49 labelled b_1(2)* 71 to 72 labelled c_1(3)* 72 to 49 labelled b_1(3)

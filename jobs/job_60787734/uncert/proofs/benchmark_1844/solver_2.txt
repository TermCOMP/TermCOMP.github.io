The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A^1(b(x1)) -> B^1(A(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(A^1(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [0A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[1A, 0A, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A], [0A, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(B^1(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(A(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, -I], [0A, 0A, 0A], [0A, -I, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[-I], [0A], [1A]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A], [0A, 0A, 1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(B(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [-I], [-I]] 	 +  	[[-I, -I, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A], [0A, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81

Node 14 is start node and node 15 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 14 to 16 labelled b_1(0)* 15 to 15 labelled #_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled a_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled b_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled a_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled b_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 24 to 25 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(0)* 25 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 15 labelled a_1(0)* 26 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 71 to 72 labelled a_1(1)* 72 to 73 labelled b_1(1)* 73 to 74 labelled a_1(1)* 74 to 75 labelled a_1(1)* 75 to 76 labelled b_1(1)* 76 to 77 labelled a_1(1)* 77 to 78 labelled b_1(1)* 78 to 79 labelled a_1(1)* 78 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 79 to 80 labelled a_1(1)* 79 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 80 to 81 labelled a_1(1)* 80 to 71 labelled b_1(1)* 81 to 15 labelled a_1(1)* 81 to 71 labelled b_1(1)

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(x1)))))))))) -> a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

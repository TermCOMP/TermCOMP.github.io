(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(b(c(x1))))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(b(b(x1))) -> C(x1)
   C(b(x1)) -> A(a(x1))
   C(b(x1)) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(b(c(x1))))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(a(x1))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C(b(x1)) -> A(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(A(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [0A], [-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, 1A], [1A, 0A, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(C(x_1)) =  	[[1A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, 0A], [-I, 0A, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, -I, 0A], [-I, -I, 0A], [-I, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(b(c(x1))))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(a(x1))

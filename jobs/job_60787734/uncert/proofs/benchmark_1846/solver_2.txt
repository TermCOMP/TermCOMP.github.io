Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(a(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   a(a(b(x1))) -> a(d(b(x1)))
   a(b(x1)) -> b(a(a(x1)))
   d(d(x1)) -> a(d(b(x1)))
   b(b(x1)) -> b(c(x1))
   a(d(c(x1))) -> c(a(x1))
   b(c(x1)) -> a(a(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(a(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> b(d(a(x1)))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   d(d(x1)) -> b(d(a(x1)))
   b(b(x1)) -> c(b(x1))
   c(d(a(x1))) -> a(c(x1))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(a(a(x1)))

Q is empty.

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 4. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(c(a(x1))) -> c(a(c(x1)))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> b(d(a(x1)))
   b(a(x1)) -> a(a(b(x1)))
   d(d(x1)) -> b(d(a(x1)))
   b(b(x1)) -> c(b(x1))
   c(d(a(x1))) -> a(c(x1))
   c(b(x1)) -> a(a(a(x1)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 172, 173

Node 107 is start node and node 108 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 0 1 1 0 1 ⟶ 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 1 ↦ 0, 0 ↦ 1 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 1-rule system (1 strict rule)
{ 0 1 0 0 1 1 ⟶ 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 }

Removing 1 relatively RFC-match-bounded rule [Geser/Hofbauer/Waldmann, WST 2022]
  (bounded by 1 for B = 5). The certifying automaton has 6 epsilon transitions:
  { (0,0,5) ⟶ (1,0,0), (0,0,6) ⟶ (0,0,0), (1,0,5) ⟶ (1,0,0), (1,0,6) ⟶ (0,0,0), (1,0,8) ⟶ (1,0,0), (1,0,8) ⟶ (0,0,5) }
After renaming modulo the bijection {  },
  it remains to prove termination of the 0-rules system (0 strict rules)
{ }

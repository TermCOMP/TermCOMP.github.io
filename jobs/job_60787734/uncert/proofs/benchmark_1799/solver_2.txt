(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(b(a(b(x1)))))) -> a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(x1))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(b(b(a(b(x1)))))) -> a(b(b(a(a(b(b(a(x1))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   a(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> b(b(a(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(b(x1))))) -> b(b(a(a(b(b(a(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(b(b(a(x1))))) -> a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(a(b(b(a(x1))))) -> a(b(b(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118

Node 93 is start node and node 94 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 93 to 95 labelled a_1(0)* 94 to 94 labelled #_1(0)* 95 to 96 labelled b_1(0)* 96 to 97 labelled b_1(0)* 97 to 98 labelled a_1(0)* 98 to 99 labelled a_1(0)* 99 to 100 labelled b_1(0)* 99 to 107 labelled a_1(1)* 100 to 94 labelled b_1(0)* 100 to 101 labelled a_1(1)* 101 to 102 labelled b_1(1)* 102 to 103 labelled b_1(1)* 103 to 104 labelled a_1(1)* 104 to 105 labelled a_1(1)* 105 to 106 labelled b_1(1)* 105 to 113 labelled a_1(2)* 106 to 94 labelled b_1(1)* 106 to 101 labelled a_1(1)* 107 to 108 labelled b_1(1)* 108 to 109 labelled b_1(1)* 109 to 110 labelled a_1(1)* 110 to 111 labelled a_1(1)* 111 to 112 labelled b_1(1)* 111 to 113 labelled a_1(2)* 112 to 104 labelled b_1(1)* 112 to 101 labelled a_1(1)* 113 to 114 labelled b_1(2)* 114 to 115 labelled b_1(2)* 115 to 116 labelled a_1(2)* 116 to 117 labelled a_1(2)* 117 to 118 labelled b_1(2)* 117 to 113 labelled a_1(2)* 118 to 104 labelled b_1(2)* 118 to 101 labelled a_1(1)

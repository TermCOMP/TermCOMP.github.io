Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(b(a(x1))))
   a(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(b(a(x1))))




----------------------------------------

(2)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

   A(a(b(b(x1)))) -> A(a(x1))
   A(a(b(b(x1)))) -> A(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(a(b(b(x1)))) -> b(b(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

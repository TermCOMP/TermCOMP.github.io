Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1))))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))) -> b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(a(b(b(x1))))))) -> b(b(a(a(a(a(b(b(a(a(a(a(a(x1)))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 159, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172

Node 123 is start node and node 124 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 123 to 125 labelled b_1(0)* 124 to 124 labelled #_1(0)* 125 to 126 labelled b_1(0)* 126 to 127 labelled a_1(0)* 127 to 128 labelled a_1(0)* 128 to 129 labelled a_1(0)* 129 to 130 labelled a_1(0)* 130 to 131 labelled b_1(0)* 131 to 132 labelled b_1(0)* 132 to 133 labelled a_1(0)* 132 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 133 to 134 labelled a_1(0)* 133 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 134 to 135 labelled a_1(0)* 134 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 135 to 136 labelled a_1(0)* 135 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 136 to 124 labelled a_1(0)* 136 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 159 to 162 labelled b_1(1)* 162 to 163 labelled a_1(1)* 163 to 164 labelled a_1(1)* 164 to 165 labelled a_1(1)* 165 to 166 labelled a_1(1)* 166 to 167 labelled b_1(1)* 167 to 168 labelled b_1(1)* 168 to 169 labelled a_1(1)* 168 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 169 to 170 labelled a_1(1)* 169 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 170 to 171 labelled a_1(1)* 170 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 171 to 172 labelled a_1(1)* 171 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 172 to 124 labelled a_1(1)* 172 to 159 labelled b_1(1)

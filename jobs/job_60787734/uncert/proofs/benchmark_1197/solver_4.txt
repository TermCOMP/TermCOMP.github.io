Proof:

After renaming modulo the bijection { a ↦ 0, b ↦ 1, c ↦ 2 },
  it remains to prove termination of the 3-rules system (3 strict rules)
{ 0 ⟶ ,
  0 1 ⟶ 1 2 0 0 0 ,
  0 2 2 ⟶ 1 }

Reversing the system.
After renaming modulo the bijection { 0 ↦ 0, 1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 2 },

{ 0 ⟶ ,
  1 0 ⟶ 0 0 0 2 1 ,
  2 2 0 ⟶ 1 }

Incorporating context-free projections into matching.

  Possible projection steps are implicit:

0 1 1 1 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 2 0 at position 0 results in
1 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 2 0 at position 4 results in
1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 0 1 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 2 0 at position 8 results in
1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 0 1 1
    Applying rule 2 2 1 ⟶ 0 at position 0 results in
0 1 1 2 0 1 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 2 0 at position 4 results in
0 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 0 1
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 2 0 at position 8 results in
0 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 0
    Applying rule 2 2 1 ⟶ 0 at position 3 results in
0 1 1 0 1 1 2 0
    Applying rule 0 1 ⟶ 1 1 1 2 0 at position 3 results in

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(x1))) -> c(a(c(a(a(x1)))))
   a(c(x1)) -> b(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(a(c(a(c(x1)))))
   c(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(a(c(a(c(x1)))))
   c(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   b(a(a(x0)))
   c(a(x0))


----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   B(a(a(x1))) -> C(a(c(x1)))
   B(a(a(x1))) -> C(x1)
   C(a(x1)) -> B(x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(a(c(a(c(x1)))))
   c(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   b(a(a(x0)))
   c(a(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B(a(a(x1))) -> C(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(B(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [1A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, -I], [0A, 0A, 0A], [1A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(C(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, -I], [0A, -I, -I], [1A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, -I], [0A, 0A, -I], [0A, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   c(a(x1)) -> a(b(x1))
   b(a(a(x1))) -> a(a(c(a(c(x1)))))


----------------------------------------

   C(a(x1)) -> B(x1)

   b(a(a(x0)))

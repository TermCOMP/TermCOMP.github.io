We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> B_{A_1}^1(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(48) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> A_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
   B_{BAABAA_1}^2(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> B_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1)) -> A_{A_1}^1(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{BAA_1}(x1)))))))

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> A_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{BAABAA_1}^2(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> B_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{BAA_1}(x1))) -> A_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1))
   A_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{A_1}(x1))) -> A_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{A_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   ABA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> ABA_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(83) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   ABA_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{BAA_1}(x1))) -> ABA_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   ABA_{A_1}^1(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> ABA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   ABA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> ABA_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(102) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   AB_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> AB_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(106) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   AB_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{A_1}(x1))) -> AB_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{A_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(110) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   AB_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{BAA_1}(x1))) -> AB_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   AB_{A_1}^1(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> AB_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   AB_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> AB_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAABAA_{A_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> BAABAA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   BAABAA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> BAABAA_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(148) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAABA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> BAABA_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(152) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAABA_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{A_1}(x1))) -> BAABA_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{A_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAABA_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{BAA_1}(x1))) -> BAABA_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAABA_{A_1}^1(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> BAABA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   BAABA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> BAABA_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAAB_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> BAAB_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAAB_{A_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> BAAB_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   BAAB_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> BAAB_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{BAABAA_1}^2(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> A_{A_1}^2(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{A_1}^2(a_{AB_1}(AB_{A_1}(x1))) -> A_{ABA_1}^2(ABA_{A_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{A_1}^2(a_{AB_1}(AB_{BAA_1}(x1))) -> A_{ABA_1}^2(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1))
   A_{ABA_1}^2(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1)) -> A_{A_1}^2(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{BAA_1}(x1)))))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{BAABAA_1}^2(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> A_{A_1}^2(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
   A_{A_1}^2(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> A_{BAABAA_1}^2(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(215) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1)) -> BAA_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(219) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAA_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{A_1}(x1))) -> BAA_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{A_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAA_{A_1}^1(a_{AB_1}(AB_{BAA_1}(x1))) -> BAA_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BAA_{A_1}^1(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> BAA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   BAA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> BAA_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   BA_{A_1}^1(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> BA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   BA_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> BA_{A_1}^1(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

(261) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BA_1}(x1))) -> B_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{AB_1}(AB_{A_1}(x1))) -> B_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{A_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{AB_1}(AB_{BAA_1}(x1))) -> B_{ABA_1}^1(ABA_{BAA_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   B_{A_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(BAABA_{BAABA_1}(x1))) -> B_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1))
   B_{BAABAA_1}^1(BAABAA_{BAABA_1}(x1)) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{BAABA_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

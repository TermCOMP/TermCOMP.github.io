The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1

   POL(2(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(5^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

(20) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   0^1(1(2(x1))) -> 0^1(x1)
   0^1(1(2(x1))) -> 0^1(4(x1))
   0^1(1(2(x1))) -> 4^1(x1)
   4^1(2(0(1(2(x1))))) -> 0^1(x1)
   0^1(1(2(x1))) -> 4^1(0(x1))
   0^1(1(2(x1))) -> 4^1(0(4(x1)))
   0^1(1(4(2(x1)))) -> 4^1(0(x1))
   0^1(1(4(2(x1)))) -> 0^1(x1)
   0^1(1(4(2(x1)))) -> 4^1(x1)
   0^1(1(0(1(2(x1))))) -> 0^1(x1)
   0^1(1(2(3(5(x1))))) -> 4^1(5(2(x1)))
   0^1(1(4(0(2(x1))))) -> 0^1(x1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(0^1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(2(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(3(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(4^1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(5(x_1)) = x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

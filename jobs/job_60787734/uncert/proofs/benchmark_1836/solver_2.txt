Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(l(x1)) -> l(a(x1))
   r(a(a(x1))) -> a(a(r(x1)))
   b(l(x1)) -> b(a(r(x1)))
   r(b(x1)) -> l(b(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(l(x1)) -> l(a(x1))
   r(a(a(x1))) -> a(a(r(x1)))
   b(l(x1)) -> b(a(r(x1)))
   r(b(x1)) -> l(b(x1))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 8 labelled l_1(0)* 1 to 9 labelled a_1(0), b_1(0)* 1 to 22 labelled l_1(1)* 1 to 23 labelled b_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 8 to 2 labelled a_1(0), b_1(0)* 8 to 17 labelled l_1(1)* 8 to 18 labelled b_1(1)* 8 to 26 labelled b_1(2)* 9 to 10 labelled a_1(0)* 9 to 21 labelled l_1(1)* 10 to 2 labelled r_1(0)* 10 to 18 labelled a_1(1)* 10 to 20 labelled l_1(1)* 10 to 28 labelled l_1(2)* 17 to 2 labelled a_1(1)* 17 to 17 labelled l_1(1)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(1)* 18 to 25 labelled l_1(2)* 19 to 2 labelled r_1(1)* 19 to 18 labelled a_1(1)* 19 to 20 labelled l_1(1)* 19 to 28 labelled l_1(2)* 20 to 2 labelled b_1(1)* 20 to 18 labelled b_1(1)* 20 to 26 labelled b_1(2)* 21 to 20 labelled a_1(1)* 21 to 28 labelled a_1(1)* 22 to 21 labelled a_1(1)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(1)* 24 to 21 labelled r_1(1)* 24 to 26 labelled a_1(2)* 25 to 20 labelled a_1(2)* 25 to 28 labelled a_1(2)* 26 to 27 labelled a_1(2)* 27 to 25 labelled r_1(2)* 27 to 29 labelled a_1(3)* 28 to 25 labelled a_1(2)* 29 to 30 labelled a_1(3)* 30 to 25 labelled r_1(3)* 30 to 29 labelled a_1(3)

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(b(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(b(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(b(a(x1))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(b(a(x1))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(x1)))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(a(b(a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180

Node 163 is start node and node 164 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 163 to 165 labelled b_1(0)* 164 to 164 labelled #_1(0)* 165 to 166 labelled a_1(0)* 166 to 167 labelled a_1(0)* 167 to 168 labelled b_1(0)* 168 to 169 labelled a_1(0)* 169 to 170 labelled b_1(0)* 170 to 171 labelled a_1(0)* 170 to 173 labelled b_1(1)* 171 to 172 labelled b_1(0)* 172 to 164 labelled a_1(0)* 172 to 173 labelled b_1(1)* 173 to 174 labelled a_1(1)* 174 to 175 labelled a_1(1)* 175 to 176 labelled b_1(1)* 176 to 177 labelled a_1(1)* 177 to 178 labelled b_1(1)* 178 to 179 labelled a_1(1)* 178 to 173 labelled b_1(1)* 179 to 180 labelled b_1(1)* 180 to 164 labelled a_1(1)* 180 to 173 labelled b_1(1)

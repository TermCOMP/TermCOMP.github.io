Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> x1
   a(c(x1)) -> c(c(x1))
   b(c(x1)) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(x1))) -> a(x1)
   b(a(b(x1))) -> b(x1)

   a(a(c(x1))) -> a(c(c(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = 3 + x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> c_{b_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))) -> c_{c_1}(x1)
   c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1))) -> c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{a_1}(x1)))
   c_{a_1}(a_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1))) -> c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))

(22) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{B_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))
   A_{B_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( A_{B_1}_1(x_1) ) = max{0, 2x_1 - 1}
POL( b_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1
POL( a_{b_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1
POL( b_{c_1}_1(x_1) ) = x_1 + 1
POL( c_{c_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1 + 1
POL( a_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1
POL( b_{b_1}_1(x_1) ) = 0
POL( a_{c_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2x_1 + 2
POL( c_{a_1}_1(x_1) ) = 2
POL( c_{b_1}_1(x_1) ) = 0

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))))

Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1))) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))) -> a_{c_1}(x1)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(24) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.

(25)
YES

Q is empty.

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

   a(b(b(x1))) -> b(b(b(b(b(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))

We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

(16) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*B_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> B_{B_1}(x1)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

(19) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> A_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   A_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))) -> A_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{A_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 0

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))))

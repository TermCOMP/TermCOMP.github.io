(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1))))))))))) -> a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1))))))))))) -> a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))) -> b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))) -> b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(x1)))))))) -> a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   b(b(a(b(b(b(b(a(x1)))))))) -> a(b(b(b(b(a(b(b(a(b(b(x1)))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 15 labelled a_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 15 to 16 labelled b_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled b_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled b_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled b_1(0)* 20 to 125 labelled a_1(1)* 21 to 22 labelled b_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled b_1(0)* 23 to 125 labelled a_1(1)* 24 to 2 labelled b_1(0)* 24 to 125 labelled a_1(1)* 125 to 126 labelled b_1(1)* 126 to 127 labelled b_1(1)* 127 to 128 labelled b_1(1)* 128 to 129 labelled b_1(1)* 129 to 130 labelled a_1(1)* 130 to 131 labelled b_1(1)* 130 to 125 labelled a_1(1)* 131 to 132 labelled b_1(1)* 132 to 133 labelled a_1(1)* 133 to 134 labelled b_1(1)* 133 to 125 labelled a_1(1)* 134 to 2 labelled b_1(1)* 134 to 125 labelled a_1(1)

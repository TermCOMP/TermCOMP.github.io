Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> x1
   a(a(a(x1))) -> b(x1)
   b(c(x1)) -> c(a(c(b(x1))))
   c(x1) -> x1

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

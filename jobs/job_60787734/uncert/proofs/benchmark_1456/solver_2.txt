Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(a(x1)))) -> b(a(b(a(x1))))
   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(a(b(a(x1))))
   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(b(b(x1)))) -> a(a(b(a(x1))))
   a(a(b(b(a(x1))))) -> a(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
   b(a(b(b(a(x1))))) -> b(b(a(b(a(x1)))))
   a(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> a(b(b(b(a(x1)))))
   b(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> b(b(b(b(a(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))

   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))

(7) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

   B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))
   B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> A_{B_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))
   A_{B_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))

   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))
   B_{A_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> B_{A_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{B_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(B_{A_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))
   a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{a_1}(x1)))))
   b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1))))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(x1)))))

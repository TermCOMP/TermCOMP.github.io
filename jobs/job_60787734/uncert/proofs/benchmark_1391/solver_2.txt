Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x1)) -> x1
   a(c(x1)) -> c(c(b(b(x1))))
   b(c(x1)) -> a(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

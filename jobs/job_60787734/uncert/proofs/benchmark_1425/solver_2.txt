Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))
   a(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(b(a(b(x1))))
   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(b(x1))
   A(b(a(a(x1)))) -> A(a(a(a(x1))))
   A(b(a(a(x1)))) -> A(a(a(x1)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))
   a(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(a(b(a(x1)))) -> A(b(x1))
   A(b(a(a(x1)))) -> A(a(a(x1)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 1 + x_1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(b(a(a(x1)))) -> a(a(a(a(x1))))
   a(a(b(a(x1)))) -> a(b(a(b(x1))))
   a(a(a(b(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(x1))))

We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A(b(a(a(x1)))) -> A(a(a(a(x1))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(A(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1)) =  	[[0A], [-I], [-I]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, 0A], [-I, 0A, 0A], [0A, 0A, 0A]] 	* 	x_1

 POL(b(x_1)) =  	[[1A], [0A], [0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 1A, 0A], [-I, -I, -I], [-I, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1

The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 1 less node.

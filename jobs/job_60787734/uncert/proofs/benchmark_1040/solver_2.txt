(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(b(x1)) -> c(c(c(c(x1))))
   c(x1) -> x1
   b(c(b(x1))) -> b(b(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(c(b(x1))) -> b(b(b(x1)))
   b(b(b(x1))) -> b(c(c(c(c(x1)))))
   c(b(b(x1))) -> c(c(c(c(c(x1)))))
   b(c(x1)) -> b(x1)
   c(c(x1)) -> c(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))
   b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))) -> b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))))
   c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))))
   c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))) -> c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))))
   b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)) -> b_{c_1}(x1)
   c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)) -> c_{b_1}(x1)
   c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)) -> c_{c_1}(x1)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))))
   b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))) -> b_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))))
   c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)))))
   c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1))) -> c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(c_{c_1}(x1)))))
   b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(x1)) -> b_{b_1}(x1)

   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b_{c_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1))) -> b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))

   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1

(11) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

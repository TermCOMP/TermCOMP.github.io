Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))))) -> a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(a(b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))))) -> a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))) -> a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(a(b(a(a(a(b(x1))))))))) -> b(a(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(a(b(a(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213

Node 190 is start node and node 191 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 190 to 192 labelled b_1(0)* 191 to 191 labelled #_1(0)* 192 to 193 labelled a_1(0)* 193 to 194 labelled a_1(0)* 194 to 195 labelled a_1(0)* 195 to 196 labelled b_1(0)* 196 to 197 labelled a_1(0)* 197 to 198 labelled a_1(0)* 197 to 203 labelled b_1(1)* 198 to 199 labelled b_1(0)* 199 to 200 labelled a_1(0)* 200 to 201 labelled a_1(0)* 200 to 203 labelled b_1(1)* 201 to 202 labelled b_1(0)* 202 to 191 labelled a_1(0)* 202 to 203 labelled b_1(1)* 203 to 204 labelled a_1(1)* 204 to 205 labelled a_1(1)* 205 to 206 labelled a_1(1)* 206 to 207 labelled b_1(1)* 207 to 208 labelled a_1(1)* 208 to 209 labelled a_1(1)* 208 to 203 labelled b_1(1)* 209 to 210 labelled b_1(1)* 210 to 211 labelled a_1(1)* 211 to 212 labelled a_1(1)* 211 to 203 labelled b_1(1)* 212 to 213 labelled b_1(1)* 213 to 191 labelled a_1(1)* 213 to 203 labelled b_1(1)

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> c(c(c(c(c(c(x1))))))
   c(c(c(c(x1)))) -> d(d(d(d(d(d(x1))))))
   b(b(x1)) -> d(d(d(d(x1))))
   c(c(d(d(d(d(x1)))))) -> a(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(b(b(x1))))))
   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> c(c(c(c(c(c(x1))))))
   c(c(c(c(x1)))) -> d(d(d(d(d(d(x1))))))
   b(b(x1)) -> d(d(d(d(x1))))
   d(d(d(d(c(c(x1)))))) -> a(a(x1))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = 66 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 44 + x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 29 + x_1
   POL(d(x_1)) = 19 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   b(b(b(b(x1)))) -> c(c(c(c(c(c(x1))))))
   c(c(c(c(x1)))) -> d(d(d(d(d(d(x1))))))
   b(b(x1)) -> d(d(d(d(x1))))
   d(d(d(d(c(c(x1)))))) -> a(a(x1))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(b(b(x1))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a(a(a(a(x1)))) -> b(b(b(b(b(b(x1))))))




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

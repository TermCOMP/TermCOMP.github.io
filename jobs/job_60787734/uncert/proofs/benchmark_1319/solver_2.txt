Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> b(c(x1))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> x1
   c(c(x1)) -> a(a(a(b(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(x1) -> c(b(x1))
   b(a(b(x1))) -> x1
   c(c(x1)) -> b(a(a(a(x1))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) FlatCCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used flat context closure [ROOTLAB]
As Q is empty the flat context closure was sound AND complete.

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x1)) -> a(c(b(x1)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RootLabelingProof (EQUIVALENT)
We used plain root labeling [ROOTLAB] with the following heuristic:
LabelAll: All function symbols get labeled

As Q is empty the root labeling was sound AND complete.

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> a_{a_1}(x1)
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))) -> a_{c_1}(x1)
   a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> a_{b_1}(x1)
   c_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> c_{b_1}(x1)
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(x1)))) -> b_{a_1}(x1)
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))) -> b_{c_1}(x1)
   b_{b_1}(b_{a_1}(a_{b_1}(b_{b_1}(x1)))) -> b_{b_1}(x1)

(13) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)

The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   A_{A_1}(a_{c_1}(x1)) -> A_{C_1}(c_{b_1}(b_{c_1}(x1)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A_{A_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(A_{C_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(B_{A_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(B_{C_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(C_{A_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(C_{B_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(a_{a_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(a_{b_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(a_{c_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(b_{b_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(b_{c_1}(x_1)) = 0
   POL(c_{a_1}(x_1)) = 1
   POL(c_{b_1}(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c_{c_1}(x_1)) = 1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

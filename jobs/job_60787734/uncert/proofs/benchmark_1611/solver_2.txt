Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   a(b(a(a(a(a(x1)))))) -> a(a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1)))))))))))))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   b(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   b(a(a(a(a(x1))))) -> a(a(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(a(a(b(x1))))) -> b(a(b(a(a(b(a(b(a(a(a(a(x1))))))))))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169

Node 14 is start node and node 15 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 14 to 16 labelled b_1(0)* 15 to 15 labelled #_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled a_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled b_1(0)* 18 to 19 labelled a_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled a_1(0)* 20 to 21 labelled b_1(0)* 21 to 22 labelled a_1(0)* 22 to 23 labelled b_1(0)* 23 to 24 labelled a_1(0)* 23 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 24 to 25 labelled a_1(0)* 24 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled a_1(0)* 25 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 26 to 15 labelled a_1(0)* 26 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 159 to 160 labelled a_1(1)* 160 to 161 labelled b_1(1)* 161 to 162 labelled a_1(1)* 162 to 163 labelled a_1(1)* 163 to 164 labelled b_1(1)* 164 to 165 labelled a_1(1)* 165 to 166 labelled b_1(1)* 166 to 167 labelled a_1(1)* 166 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 167 to 168 labelled a_1(1)* 167 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 168 to 169 labelled a_1(1)* 168 to 159 labelled b_1(1)* 169 to 15 labelled a_1(1)* 169 to 159 labelled b_1(1)

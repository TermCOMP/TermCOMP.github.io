Input TRS:
    1: +(x,0()) -> x
    2: +(x,s(y)) -> s(+(x,y))
    3: +(0(),s(y)) -> s(y)
    4: s(+(0(),y)) -> s(y)
Number of strict rules: 4
Direct Order(PosReal,>,Poly) ... removes: 4 1 3 2
     s(x1)	weight: (/ 1 4) + x1
     0()	weight: 0
     +(x1,x2)	weight: (/ 1 4) + x1 + 2 * x2
Number of strict rules: 0

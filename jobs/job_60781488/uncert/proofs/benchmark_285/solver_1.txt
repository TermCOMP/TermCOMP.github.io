* Certificate: cond(tt,s(|0|),s(_2)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following pattern rule was generated by the strategy
presented in Sect. 3 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]:
[iteration = 4] cond(tt,_0,_1){_1->s(_1), _0->s(_0)}^n{_1->s(_2), _0->s(|0|)} -> cond(tt,s(_0),s(_1)){_1->s(_1), _0->s(_0)}^n{_1->s(_2), _0->s(|0|)}
We apply Theorem 8 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]
on this rule with m = 1, b = 1, pi = epsilon,
sigma' = {} and mu' = {}.
Hence the term cond(tt,s(|0|),s(_2)), obtained from
instantiating n with 0 in the left-hand side of
the rule, starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.

Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1192

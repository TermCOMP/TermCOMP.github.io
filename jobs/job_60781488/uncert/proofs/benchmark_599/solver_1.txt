* Certificate: +(|1|,_0) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following pattern rule was generated by the strategy
presented in Sect. 3 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]:
[iteration = 1] +(|1|,_0){}^n{} -> +(|1|,_0){}^n{}
We apply Theorem 8 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]
on this rule with m = 1, b = 0, pi = epsilon,
sigma' = {} and mu' = {}.
Hence the term +(|1|,_0), obtained from
instantiating n with 0 in the left-hand side of
the rule, starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 5

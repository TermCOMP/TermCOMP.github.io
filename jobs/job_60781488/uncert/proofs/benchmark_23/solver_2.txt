(17) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   REV(cons(x, l)) -> REV2(x, l)
   REV2(x, cons(y, l)) -> REV2(y, l)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
REV(x1)  =  x1

cons(x1, x2)  =  cons(x2)

REV2(x1, x2)  =  x2

rev2(x1, x2)  =  x2

nil  =  nil

rev(x1)  =  x1


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

   cons_1=1

Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty f x)
(RULES
app(app(apply,f),x) -> app(f,x)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 app(app(apply,f),x) -> app(f,x)
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 APP(app(apply,f),x) -> APP(f,x)
-> Rules:
 app(app(apply,f),x) -> app(f,x)

Problem 1:

Problem 1: 

Subterm Processor:
-> Pairs:
 APP(app(apply,f),x) -> APP(f,x)
-> Rules:
 app(app(apply,f),x) -> app(f,x)
->Projection:
 pi(APP) = 1

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:

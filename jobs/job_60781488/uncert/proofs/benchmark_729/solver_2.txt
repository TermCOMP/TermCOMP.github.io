Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 25 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   *(x, *(y, z)) -> *(*(x, y), z)
   *(x, x) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(*(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + x_2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   *(x, x) -> x




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   *(x, *(y, z)) -> *(*(x, y), z)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(*(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + 2*x_2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   *(x, *(y, z)) -> *(*(x, y), z)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

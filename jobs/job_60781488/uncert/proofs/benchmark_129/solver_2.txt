The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
f1(x1)  =  x1

g(x1)  =  g(x1)

f(x1)  =  x1

h(x1)  =  h


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

and weight map:

   h=1
   g_1=1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   f(g(x)) -> g(f(f(x)))

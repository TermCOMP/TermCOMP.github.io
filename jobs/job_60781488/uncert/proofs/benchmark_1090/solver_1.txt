NO

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Certificate: |2nd|(cons(_0)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following generalized rule was detected
in the analyzed TRS:
|2nd|(cons(_0)) -> |2nd|(cons1(_0,_1))
Hence, the term |2nd|(cons(_0))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: f(_0,c(_0),c(g(_0,c(_0)))) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 5] f^#(_0,c(_0),c(g(_1,c(_0)))) -> f^#(_1,c(_0),c(g(_1,c(_0))))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {_1->_0} and theta2 = {_0->_0}.
We have r|p = f^#(_1,c(_0),c(g(_1,c(_0))))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = f(_0,c(_0),c(g(_0,c(_0))))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1134

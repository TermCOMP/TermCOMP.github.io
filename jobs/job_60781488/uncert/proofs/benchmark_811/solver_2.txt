Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(c(s(x), y)) -> f(c(x, s(y)))
   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   f(c(s(x), y)) -> f(c(x, s(y)))
   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))

The signature Sigma is {f_1, g_1}
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(c(s(x), y)) -> f(c(x, s(y)))
   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(c(s(x0), x1))
   g(c(x0, s(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(c(s(x), y)) -> F(c(x, s(y)))
   G(c(x, s(y))) -> G(c(s(x), y))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(c(s(x), y)) -> f(c(x, s(y)))
   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(c(s(x0), x1))
   g(c(x0, s(x1)))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Complex Obligation (AND)

----------------------------------------

(7)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(c(x, s(y))) -> G(c(s(x), y))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(c(s(x), y)) -> f(c(x, s(y)))
   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))

   f(c(s(x0), x1))
   g(c(x0, s(x1)))

----------------------------------------

(8) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

   g(c(x0, s(x1)))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(10) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(c(s(x0), x1))
   g(c(x0, s(x1)))


----------------------------------------

Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(G(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(c(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2 + x_1

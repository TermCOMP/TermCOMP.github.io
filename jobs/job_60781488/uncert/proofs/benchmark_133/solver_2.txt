The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

g1(x1)  =  g1(x1)

(25) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   f1(s(x)) -> g1(f(x))
   g1(s(x)) -> f1(g(x))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
f1(x1)  =  f1(x1)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

g1(x1)  =  x1

f(x1)  =  f(x1)

g(x1)  =  x1

0  =  0

minus(x1, x2)  =  x1


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

and weight map:

   s_1=3
   0=1
   f1_1=2
   f_1=4

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   f(0) -> s(0)
   f(s(x)) -> minus(s(x), g(f(x)))
   g(0) -> 0
   g(s(x)) -> minus(s(x), f(g(x)))
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(s(x), s(y)) -> minus(x, y)

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(0) -> 0
   g(s(x)) -> minus(s(x), f(g(x)))
   f(0) -> s(0)
   f(s(x)) -> minus(s(x), g(f(x)))
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(s(x), s(y)) -> minus(x, y)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   minus(x0, 0)
   minus(s(x0), s(x1))
   f(0)
   f(s(x0))
   g(0)
   g(s(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(27) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(map, fun), xs)
   APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
   APP(app(filter, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(app(app(filter2, app(fun, x)), fun), x), xs)
   APP(app(app(app(filter2, true), fun), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, fun), xs)
   APP(app(filter, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
   APP(app(app(app(filter2, false), fun), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, fun), xs)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(minus, x), 0) -> x
   app(app(minus, app(s, x)), app(s, y)) -> app(app(minus, x), y)
   app(f, 0) -> app(s, 0)

   app(app(app(app(filter2, false), fun), x), xs) -> app(app(filter, fun), xs)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   app(app(minus, x0), 0)
   app(app(minus, app(s, x0)), app(s, x1))
   app(f, 0)
   app(f, app(s, x0))

   app(app(app(app(filter2, true), x0), x1), x2)
   app(app(app(app(filter2, false), x0), x1), x2)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(30) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP(app(filter, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(map, fun), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(filter, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(app(app(filter2, app(fun, x)), fun), x), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 > 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, true), fun), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, fun), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2


*APP(app(app(app(filter2, false), fun), x), xs) -> APP(app(filter, fun), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   APP(g, app(g, x)) -> APP(g, app(h, app(g, x)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

----------------------------------------

(6) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06]. Here, we combined the reduction pair processor with the A-transformation [FROCOS05] which results in the following intermediate Q-DP Problem.
 The a-transformed P is 

   g1(g(x)) -> g1(h(g(x)))

 The a-transformed usable rules are 

   g(g(x)) -> g(h(g(x)))
   g(h(g(x))) -> g(x)
   h(h(x)) -> h(f(h(x), x))




The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   APP(g, app(g, x)) -> APP(g, app(h, app(g, x)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
g1(x1)  =  x1

g(x1)  =  g

h(x1)  =  h


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

and weight map:

   h=1
   g=2

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   app(g, app(g, x)) -> app(g, app(h, app(g, x)))
   app(g, app(h, app(g, x))) -> app(g, x)
   app(h, app(h, x)) -> app(h, app(app(f, app(h, x)), x))

(13) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP(app(filter, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(fun, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, fun), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(map, fun), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2

(0) QTRS
(1) DependencyPairsProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]

(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(X, Y), Z) -> f(X, f(Y, Z))
   f(X, f(Y, Z)) -> f(Y, Y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(f(X, Y), Z) -> F(X, f(Y, Z))
   F(f(X, Y), Z) -> F(Y, Z)
   F(X, f(Y, Z)) -> F(Y, Y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(X, Y), Z) -> f(X, f(Y, Z))
   f(X, f(Y, Z)) -> f(Y, Y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(f(X, Y), Z) -> F(X, f(Y, Z))
   F(f(X, Y), Z) -> F(Y, Z)
   F(X, f(Y, Z)) -> F(Y, Y)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(F(x_1, x_2)) = x_1*x_2 + 2*x_1^2 + 2*x_2
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + x_1*x_2 + 2*x_1^2 + 2*x_2

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   f(X, f(Y, Z)) -> f(Y, Y)
   f(f(X, Y), Z) -> f(X, f(Y, Z))


----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(X, Y), Z) -> f(X, f(Y, Z))
   f(X, f(Y, Z)) -> f(Y, Y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

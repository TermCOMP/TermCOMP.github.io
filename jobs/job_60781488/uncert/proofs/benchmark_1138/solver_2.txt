Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(X) -> g(h(f(X)))
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(mark(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> g(X)
   mark(h(X)) -> h(mark(X))
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a__f(X) -> g(h(f(X)))
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(mark(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> g(X)
   mark(h(X)) -> h(mark(X))
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 5 labelled g_1(0)* 3 to 9 labelled a__f_1(0), h_1(0), f_1(1)* 3 to 4 labelled g_1(0), f_1(0)* 3 to 11 labelled g_1(1)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled h_1(0)* 6 to 4 labelled f_1(0)* 9 to 4 labelled mark_1(0), g_1(1)* 9 to 13 labelled a__f_1(1), h_1(1), f_1(2)* 9 to 14 labelled g_1(2)* 11 to 12 labelled h_1(1)* 12 to 9 labelled f_1(1)* 13 to 4 labelled mark_1(1), g_1(1)* 13 to 13 labelled a__f_1(1), h_1(1), f_1(2)* 13 to 14 labelled g_1(2)* 14 to 15 labelled h_1(2)* 15 to 13 labelled f_1(2)

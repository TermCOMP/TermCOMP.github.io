Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(x))) -> b(a(x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(a(x))) -> a(b(x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(a(x))) -> a(b(x))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 7

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled a_1(0)* 1 to 7 labelled a_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 2 labelled b_1(0)* 7 to 2 labelled b_1(1)

(4)
YES

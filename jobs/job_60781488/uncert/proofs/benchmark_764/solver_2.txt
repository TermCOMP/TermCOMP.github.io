Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(x, 0) -> x
   +(x, s(y)) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(0, y) -> y
   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(x, +(y, z)) -> +(+(x, y), z)
   f(g(f(x))) -> f(h(s(0), x))
   f(g(h(x, y))) -> f(h(s(x), y))
   f(h(x, h(y, z))) -> f(h(+(x, y), z))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(+(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(0) = 0
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(h(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   +(x, 0) -> x
   +(0, y) -> y
   +(x, +(y, z)) -> +(+(x, y), z)
   f(g(f(x))) -> f(h(s(0), x))
   f(g(h(x, y))) -> f(h(s(x), y))
   f(h(x, h(y, z))) -> f(h(+(x, y), z))




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   +(x, s(y)) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:+_2 > s_1

and weight map:

   s_1=1
   +_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   +(x, s(y)) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

(6)
YES

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> f(g(f(x), x))
   f(f(x)) -> f(h(f(x), f(x)))
   g(x, y) -> y
   h(x, x) -> g(x, 0)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(f(x)) -> F(g(f(x), x))
   F(f(x)) -> G(f(x), x)
   F(f(x)) -> F(h(f(x), f(x)))
   F(f(x)) -> H(f(x), f(x))
   H(x, x) -> G(x, 0)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> f(g(f(x), x))
   f(f(x)) -> f(h(f(x), f(x)))
   g(x, y) -> y
   h(x, x) -> g(x, 0)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 3 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(f(x)) -> F(h(f(x), f(x)))
   F(f(x)) -> F(g(f(x), x))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> f(g(f(x), x))
   f(f(x)) -> f(h(f(x), f(x)))
   g(x, y) -> y
   h(x, x) -> g(x, 0)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(f(x)) -> F(h(f(x), f(x)))
   F(f(x)) -> F(g(f(x), x))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
F(x1)  =  x1

f(x1)  =  f(x1)

h(x1, x2)  =  h

g(x1, x2)  =  x2

0  =  0


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

and weight map:

   0=1
   h=2
   f_1=2

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   h(x, x) -> g(x, 0)
   g(x, y) -> y


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> f(g(f(x), x))
   f(f(x)) -> f(h(f(x), f(x)))
   g(x, y) -> y
   h(x, x) -> g(x, 0)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

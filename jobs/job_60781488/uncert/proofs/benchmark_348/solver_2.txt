Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(x)) -> g(g(f(x)))
   f(g(x)) -> g(g(g(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(g(x)) -> g(g(f(x)))
   f(g(x)) -> g(g(g(x)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 7 labelled g_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled g_1(0)* 8 to 2 labelled f_1(0), g_1(0)* 8 to 10 labelled g_1(1)* 10 to 12 labelled g_1(1)* 12 to 2 labelled f_1(1), g_1(1)* 12 to 10 labelled g_1(1)

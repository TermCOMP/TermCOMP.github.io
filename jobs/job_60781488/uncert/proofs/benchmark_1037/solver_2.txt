Termination of the given GTRS could be disproven:

(0) GTRS
(1) CritRuleProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Generalized rewrite system (where rules with free variables on rhs are allowed):
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   after(s(N), cons(X)) -> after(N, XS)
   from(X) -> cons(X)
   after(0, XS) -> XS


----------------------------------------

(1) CritRuleProof (COMPLETE)
The rule after(s(N), cons(X)) -> after(N, XS) contains free variables in its right-hand side. Hence the TRS is not-terminating.
----------------------------------------

(2)
NO

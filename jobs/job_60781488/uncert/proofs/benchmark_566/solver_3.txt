Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty X Y)
(RULES
f(s(X),Y) -> h(s(f(h(Y),X)))
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(s(X),Y) -> h(s(f(h(Y),X)))
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(s(X),Y) -> h(s(f(h(Y),X)))

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 f(s(X),Y) -> h(s(f(h(Y),X)))
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(X)) -> f(g(f(g(f(X)))))
   f(g(f(X))) -> f(g(X))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(X)) -> f(g(f(g(f(X)))))
   f(g(f(X))) -> g(f(X))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(X)) -> f(g(f(g(f(X)))))
   f(g(f(X))) -> g(f(X))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 16 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 19 labelled g_1(0)* 1 to 24 labelled g_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 16 to 17 labelled g_1(0)* 17 to 18 labelled f_1(0)* 17 to 23 labelled g_1(1)* 17 to 19 labelled g_1(1)* 18 to 19 labelled g_1(0)* 19 to 2 labelled f_1(0)* 19 to 20 labelled f_1(1)* 19 to 23 labelled g_1(1)* 19 to 25 labelled g_1(2)* 20 to 21 labelled g_1(1)* 21 to 22 labelled f_1(1)* 21 to 26 labelled g_1(2)* 22 to 23 labelled g_1(1)* 23 to 2 labelled f_1(1)* 23 to 20 labelled f_1(1)* 23 to 23 labelled g_1(1)* 23 to 25 labelled g_1(2)* 24 to 18 labelled f_1(1)* 24 to 23 labelled g_1(1)* 24 to 19 labelled g_1(1)* 25 to 22 labelled f_1(2)* 25 to 26 labelled g_1(2)* 26 to 2 labelled f_1(2)* 26 to 20 labelled f_1(1), f_1(2)* 26 to 23 labelled g_1(1)* 26 to 25 labelled g_1(2)

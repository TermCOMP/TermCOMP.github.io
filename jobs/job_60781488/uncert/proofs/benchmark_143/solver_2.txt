As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

(34) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   log1(s(s(x))) -> log1(s(quot(x, s(s(0)))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
log1(x1)  =  x1

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

quot(x1, x2)  =  x1

0  =  0

minus(x1, x2)  =  x1


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

and weight map:

   s_1=1
   0=1

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   quot(0, s(y)) -> 0
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(quot(minus(x, y), s(y)))

   minus(s(x), s(y)) -> minus(x, y)

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(map, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(map, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: a__length(cons(_0,zeros)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 3] a__length^#(cons(_0,zeros)) -> a__length^#(cons(|0|,zeros))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {} and theta2 = {_0->|0|}.
We have r|p = a__length^#(cons(|0|,zeros))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = a__length(cons(_0,zeros))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1918

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) DependencyPairsProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QDP
(3) QDPSizeChangeProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y
   f(0, 1, x) -> f(s(x), x, x)
   f(x, y, s(z)) -> s(f(0, 1, z))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(0, 1, x) -> F(s(x), x, x)
   F(x, y, s(z)) -> F(0, 1, z)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y
   f(0, 1, x) -> f(s(x), x, x)
   f(x, y, s(z)) -> s(f(0, 1, z))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*F(x, y, s(z)) -> F(0, 1, z)
The graph contains the following edges 3 > 3


*F(0, 1, x) -> F(s(x), x, x)
The graph contains the following edges 3 >= 2, 3 >= 3


----------------------------------------

(4)
YES

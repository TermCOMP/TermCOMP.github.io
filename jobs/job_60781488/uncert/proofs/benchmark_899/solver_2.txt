(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(f(g(f(a))))
   active(g(X)) -> g(active(X))
   g(mark(X)) -> mark(g(X))
   proper(f(X)) -> f(proper(X))
   proper(a) -> ok(a)
   proper(g(X)) -> g(proper(X))
   f(ok(X)) -> ok(f(X))
   g(ok(X)) -> ok(g(X))
   top(mark(X)) -> top(proper(X))
   top(ok(X)) -> top(active(X))

Q is empty.

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a'(f(f(active(x)))) -> a'(f(g(f(mark(x)))))
   g(active(X)) -> active(g(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> g(mark(X))
   f(proper(X)) -> proper(f(X))
   a'(proper(x)) -> a'(ok(x))
   g(proper(X)) -> proper(g(X))
   ok(f(X)) -> f(ok(X))
   ok(g(X)) -> g(ok(X))
   mark(top(X)) -> proper(top(X))
   ok(top(X)) -> active(top(X))

Q is empty.

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 6. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a'(f(f(active(x)))) -> a'(f(g(f(mark(x)))))
   g(active(X)) -> active(g(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> g(mark(X))
   f(proper(X)) -> proper(f(X))
   a'(proper(x)) -> a'(ok(x))
   g(proper(X)) -> proper(g(X))
   ok(f(X)) -> f(ok(X))
   ok(g(X)) -> g(ok(X))
   mark(top(X)) -> proper(top(X))
   ok(top(X)) -> active(top(X))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78

Node 9 is start node and node 10 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

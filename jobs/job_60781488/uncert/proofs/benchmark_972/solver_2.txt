----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> f(c)
   c -> b

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> c'(f(X))
   c'(x) -> b'(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> c'(f(X))
   c'(x) -> b'(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0)
   c'(x0)


----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(X) -> C'(f(X))
   F(X) -> F(X)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> c'(f(X))
   c'(x) -> b'(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0)
   c'(x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(X) -> F(X)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> c'(f(X))
   c'(x) -> b'(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0)
   c'(x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(X) -> F(X)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0)
   c'(x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(x0)
   c'(x0)


----------------------------------------

(12)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(X) -> F(X)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = F(X) evaluates to  t =F(X)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from F(X) to F(X).

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> s(0)
   f(s(0)) -> s(0)
   f(s(s(x))) -> f(f(s(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0'(f(x)) -> 0'(s(x))
   0'(s(f(x))) -> 0'(s(x))
   s(s(f(x))) -> s(f(f(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   0'(f(x)) -> 0'(s(x))
   0'(s(f(x))) -> 0'(s(x))
   s(s(f(x))) -> s(f(f(x)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 8 labelled 0'_1(0)* 1 to 9 labelled s_1(0)* 1 to 16 labelled 0'_1(1)* 1 to 18 labelled 0'_1(2)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 8 to 2 labelled s_1(0)* 8 to 14 labelled s_1(1)* 9 to 10 labelled f_1(0)* 10 to 2 labelled f_1(0)* 14 to 15 labelled f_1(1)* 15 to 2 labelled f_1(1)* 16 to 2 labelled s_1(1)* 16 to 14 labelled s_1(1)* 16 to 15 labelled s_1(1)* 18 to 15 labelled s_1(2)* 18 to 2 labelled s_1(2)* 18 to 14 labelled s_1(1)

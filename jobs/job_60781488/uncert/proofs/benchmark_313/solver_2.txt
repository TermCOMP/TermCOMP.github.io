----------------------------------------

(19) NonInfProof (EQUIVALENT)
The DP Problem is simplified using the Induction Calculus [NONINF] with the following steps:

Note that final constraints are written in bold face.



For Pair COND(true, x, y) -> COND(gr(x, y), y, x) the following chains were created:
*We consider the chain COND(true, x0, x1) -> COND(gr(x0, x1), x1, x0), COND(true, x2, x3) -> COND(gr(x2, x3), x3, x2) which results in the following constraint:

(1)    (COND(gr(x0, x1), x1, x0)=COND(true, x2, x3)  ==>  COND(true, x2, x3)_>=_COND(gr(x2, x3), x3, x2))



We simplified constraint (1) using rules (I), (II), (III) which results in the following new constraint:

(2)    (gr(x0, x1)=true  ==>  COND(true, x1, x0)_>=_COND(gr(x1, x0), x0, x1))



We simplified constraint (2) using rule (V) (with possible (I) afterwards) using induction on gr(x0, x1)=true which results in the following new constraints:

(3)    (true=true  ==>  COND(true, 0, s(x5))_>=_COND(gr(0, s(x5)), s(x5), 0))

(4)    (gr(x7, x6)=true & (gr(x7, x6)=true  ==>  COND(true, x6, x7)_>=_COND(gr(x6, x7), x7, x6))  ==>  COND(true, s(x6), s(x7))_>=_COND(gr(s(x6), s(x7)), s(x7), s(x6)))



We simplified constraint (3) using rules (I), (II) which results in the following new constraint:

(5)    (COND(true, 0, s(x5))_>=_COND(gr(0, s(x5)), s(x5), 0))



We simplified constraint (4) using rule (VI) where we applied the induction hypothesis (gr(x7, x6)=true  ==>  COND(true, x6, x7)_>=_COND(gr(x6, x7), x7, x6)) with sigma = [ ] which results in the following new constraint:

(6)    (COND(true, x6, x7)_>=_COND(gr(x6, x7), x7, x6)  ==>  COND(true, s(x6), s(x7))_>=_COND(gr(s(x6), s(x7)), s(x7), s(x6)))








To summarize, we get the following constraints P__>=_ for the following pairs.

*COND(true, x, y) -> COND(gr(x, y), y, x)

*(COND(true, 0, s(x5))_>=_COND(gr(0, s(x5)), s(x5), 0))


*(COND(true, x6, x7)_>=_COND(gr(x6, x7), x7, x6)  ==>  COND(true, s(x6), s(x7))_>=_COND(gr(s(x6), s(x7)), s(x7), s(x6)))








The constraints for P_> respective P_bound are constructed from P__>=_ where we just replace every occurence of "t _>=_ s" in P__>=_ by  "t > s" respective "t _>=_ c". Here c stands for the fresh constant used for P_bound. 

Using the following integer polynomial ordering the  resulting constraints can be solved 

Polynomial interpretation [NONINF]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(COND(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = -1 - x_1 - x_2 + x_3
   POL(c) = -1
   POL(false) = 0
   POL(gr(x_1, x_2)) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(true) = 0


The following pairs  are in P_>:
   COND(true, x, y) -> COND(gr(x, y), y, x)
The following pairs are in P_bound:
   COND(true, x, y) -> COND(gr(x, y), y, x)
The following rules are usable:
   false -> gr(0, x)
   true -> gr(s(x), 0)
   gr(x, y) -> gr(s(x), s(y))

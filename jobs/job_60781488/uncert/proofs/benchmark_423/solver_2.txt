(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> p(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   P(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> P(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))
   P(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> P(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3))
   P(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> P(a(a(x0)), x3)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> p(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   P(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> P(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3))
   P(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> P(a(a(x0)), x3)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(P(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(p(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + 2*x_1 + x_2


----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   P(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> P(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> p(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   P(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> P(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO,RATPOLO]:

   POL(P(x_1, x_2)) = [1/4]x_1 + [1/2]x_2
   POL(a(x_1)) = [1/4] + [4]x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 0
   POL(p(x_1, x_2)) = [1/4]x_1 + [1/2]x_2
The value of delta used in the strict ordering is 3/32.
The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   p(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> p(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(a(a(x0)), p(x1, p(a(x2), x3))) -> p(x2, p(a(a(b(x1))), p(a(a(x0)), x3)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(x, f(a, f(f(a, a), a)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(x, f(a, f(f(a, a), a)))
   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(a, f(f(a, a), a))
   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(f(a, a), a)
   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(a, a)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(x, f(a, f(f(a, a), a)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 3 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(x, f(a, f(f(a, a), a)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(x, f(a, f(f(a, a), a)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(x, f(a, f(f(a, a), a)))

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(x, f(a, f(f(a, a), a)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( F_2(x_1, x_2) ) = x_1 + x_2
POL( a ) = 2
POL( f_2(x_1, x_2) ) = max{0, x_2 - 1}

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:
none


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

(19) NonInfProof (EQUIVALENT)
The DP Problem is simplified using the Induction Calculus [NONINF] with the following steps:

Note that final constraints are written in bold face.



For Pair COND(true, x, y) -> MINUS(x, s(y)) the following chains were created:
*We consider the chain MINUS(x2, x3) -> COND(gt(x2, x3), x2, x3), COND(true, x4, x5) -> MINUS(x4, s(x5)) which results in the following constraint:

(1)    (COND(gt(x2, x3), x2, x3)=COND(true, x4, x5)  ==>  COND(true, x4, x5)_>=_MINUS(x4, s(x5)))



We simplified constraint (1) using rules (I), (II), (III) which results in the following new constraint:

(2)    (gt(x2, x3)=true  ==>  COND(true, x2, x3)_>=_MINUS(x2, s(x3)))



We simplified constraint (2) using rule (V) (with possible (I) afterwards) using induction on gt(x2, x3)=true which results in the following new constraints:

(3)    (true=true  ==>  COND(true, s(x13), 0)_>=_MINUS(s(x13), s(0)))

(4)    (gt(x15, x14)=true & (gt(x15, x14)=true  ==>  COND(true, x15, x14)_>=_MINUS(x15, s(x14)))  ==>  COND(true, s(x15), s(x14))_>=_MINUS(s(x15), s(s(x14))))



We simplified constraint (3) using rules (I), (II) which results in the following new constraint:

(5)    (COND(true, s(x13), 0)_>=_MINUS(s(x13), s(0)))



We simplified constraint (4) using rule (VI) where we applied the induction hypothesis (gt(x15, x14)=true  ==>  COND(true, x15, x14)_>=_MINUS(x15, s(x14))) with sigma = [ ] which results in the following new constraint:

(6)    (COND(true, x15, x14)_>=_MINUS(x15, s(x14))  ==>  COND(true, s(x15), s(x14))_>=_MINUS(s(x15), s(s(x14))))








For Pair MINUS(x, y) -> COND(gt(x, y), x, y) the following chains were created:
*We consider the chain COND(true, x6, x7) -> MINUS(x6, s(x7)), MINUS(x8, x9) -> COND(gt(x8, x9), x8, x9) which results in the following constraint:

(1)    (MINUS(x6, s(x7))=MINUS(x8, x9)  ==>  MINUS(x8, x9)_>=_COND(gt(x8, x9), x8, x9))



We simplified constraint (1) using rules (I), (II), (III) which results in the following new constraint:

(2)    (MINUS(x6, s(x7))_>=_COND(gt(x6, s(x7)), x6, s(x7)))








To summarize, we get the following constraints P__>=_ for the following pairs.

*COND(true, x, y) -> MINUS(x, s(y))

*(COND(true, s(x13), 0)_>=_MINUS(s(x13), s(0)))


*(COND(true, x15, x14)_>=_MINUS(x15, s(x14))  ==>  COND(true, s(x15), s(x14))_>=_MINUS(s(x15), s(s(x14))))




*MINUS(x, y) -> COND(gt(x, y), x, y)

*(MINUS(x6, s(x7))_>=_COND(gt(x6, s(x7)), x6, s(x7)))








The constraints for P_> respective P_bound are constructed from P__>=_ where we just replace every occurence of "t _>=_ s" in P__>=_ by  "t > s" respective "t _>=_ c". Here c stands for the fresh constant used for P_bound. 

Using the following integer polynomial ordering the  resulting constraints can be solved 

Polynomial interpretation [NONINF]:

   POL(0) = 1
   POL(COND(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = -1 - x_1 + x_2 - x_3
   POL(MINUS(x_1, x_2)) = -1 + x_1 - x_2
   POL(c) = -2
   POL(false) = 0
   POL(gt(x_1, x_2)) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(true) = 0


The following pairs  are in P_>:
   COND(true, x, y) -> MINUS(x, s(y))
The following pairs are in P_bound:
   COND(true, x, y) -> MINUS(x, s(y))
The following rules are usable:
   false -> gt(0, v)
   true -> gt(s(u), 0)
   gt(u, v) -> gt(s(u), s(v))

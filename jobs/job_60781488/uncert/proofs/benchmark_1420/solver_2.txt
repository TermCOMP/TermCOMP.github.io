----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, h(h(y))), x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, h(h(y))), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(x, y)) -> H(h(y))
   H(f(x, y)) -> H(y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, h(h(y))), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By narrowing [LPAR04] the rule H(f(x, y)) -> H(h(y)) at position [0] we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (H(f(y0, f(x0, x1))) -> H(f(f(a, h(h(x1))), x0)),H(f(y0, f(x0, x1))) -> H(f(f(a, h(h(x1))), x0)))


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(x, y)) -> H(y)
   H(f(y0, f(x0, x1))) -> H(f(f(a, h(h(x1))), x0))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, h(h(y))), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By forward instantiating [JAR06] the rule H(f(x, y)) -> H(y) we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (H(f(x0, f(y_0, y_1))) -> H(f(y_0, y_1)),H(f(x0, f(y_0, y_1))) -> H(f(y_0, y_1)))
   (H(f(x0, f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2)))) -> H(f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2))),H(f(x0, f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2)))) -> H(f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2))))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(y0, f(x0, x1))) -> H(f(f(a, h(h(x1))), x0))
   H(f(x0, f(y_0, y_1))) -> H(f(y_0, y_1))
   H(f(x0, f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2)))) -> H(f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, h(h(y))), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   H(f(y0, f(x0, x1))) -> H(f(f(a, h(h(x1))), x0))
   H(f(x0, f(y_0, y_1))) -> H(f(y_0, y_1))
   H(f(x0, f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2)))) -> H(f(y_0, f(y_1, y_2)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(H(x_1)) =  	[[0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(f(x_1, x_2)) =  	[[1], [1]] 	 +  	[[0, 0], [1, 1]] 	* 	x_1 	 +  	[[1, 1], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_2
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a) =  	[[0], [0]]
>>>

   <<<
 POL(h(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[0, 1], [3, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, h(h(y))), x)


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, h(h(y))), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(12)
YES

NO

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Certificate: tail(cons(_0)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following generalized rule was detected
in the analyzed TRS:
tail(cons(_0)) -> _1
Hence, the term tail(cons(_0))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1

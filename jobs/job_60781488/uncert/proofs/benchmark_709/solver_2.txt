Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(c(d(x))) -> c(x)
   u(b(d(d(x)))) -> b(x)
   v(a(a(x))) -> u(v(x))
   v(a(c(x))) -> u(b(d(x)))
   v(c(x)) -> b(x)
   w(a(a(x))) -> u(w(x))
   w(a(c(x))) -> u(b(d(x)))
   w(c(x)) -> b(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(c(d(x))) -> c(x)
   u(b(d(d(x)))) -> b(x)
   v(a(a(x))) -> u(v(x))
   v(a(c(x))) -> u(b(d(x)))
   v(c(x)) -> b(x)
   w(a(a(x))) -> u(w(x))
   w(a(c(x))) -> u(b(d(x)))
   w(c(x)) -> b(x)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 2 labelled c_1(0), b_1(0), b_1(1)* 1 to 3 labelled u_1(0)* 1 to 4 labelled u_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 2 labelled v_1(0), w_1(0), b_1(1)* 3 to 6 labelled u_1(1)* 3 to 7 labelled u_1(1)* 4 to 5 labelled b_1(0)* 5 to 2 labelled d_1(0)* 6 to 2 labelled v_1(1), w_1(1), b_1(1)* 6 to 6 labelled u_1(1)* 6 to 7 labelled u_1(1)* 7 to 8 labelled b_1(1)* 8 to 2 labelled d_1(1)

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(f(f(x))) -> q(f(g(x)))
   p(g(g(x))) -> q(g(f(x)))
   q(f(f(x))) -> p(f(g(x)))
   q(g(g(x))) -> p(g(f(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(p(x))) -> g(f(q(x)))
   g(g(p(x))) -> f(g(q(x)))
   f(f(q(x))) -> g(f(p(x)))
   g(g(q(x))) -> f(g(p(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 0. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(p(x))) -> g(f(q(x)))
   g(g(p(x))) -> f(g(q(x)))
   f(f(q(x))) -> g(f(p(x)))
   g(g(q(x))) -> f(g(p(x)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 9 labelled g_1(0)* 3 to 11 labelled f_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled f_1(0)* 10 to 4 labelled q_1(0), p_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled g_1(0)* 12 to 4 labelled q_1(0), p_1(0)

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x), x) -> f(s(x), round(x))
   round(0) -> 0

   round(s(s(x))) -> s(s(round(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), x) -> F(s(x), round(x))
   F(s(x), x) -> ROUND(x)
   ROUND(s(s(x))) -> ROUND(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x), x) -> f(s(x), round(x))
   round(0) -> 0
   round(0) -> s(0)
   round(s(0)) -> s(0)
   round(s(s(x))) -> s(s(round(x)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

(6) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

(8) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*ROUND(s(s(x))) -> ROUND(x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

   f(s(x), x) -> f(s(x), round(x))
   round(0) -> 0
   round(0) -> s(0)
   round(s(0)) -> s(0)
   round(s(s(x))) -> s(s(round(x)))

----------------------------------------

(11) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

Obligation:
Q DP problem:

   F(s(x), x) -> F(s(x), round(x))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   round(0) -> 0
   round(0) -> s(0)
   round(s(0)) -> s(0)
   round(s(s(x))) -> s(s(round(x)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by narrowing to the left:

s = F(s(0), round(0)) evaluates to  t =F(s(0), round(0))

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

F(s(0), round(0)) -> F(s(0), 0)
with rule round(0) -> 0 at position [1] and matcher [ ]

F(s(0), 0) -> F(s(0), round(0))
with rule F(s(x), x) -> F(s(x), round(x))

Now applying the matcher to the start term leads to a term which is equal to the last term in the rewriting sequence


All these steps are and every following step will be a correct step w.r.t to Q.

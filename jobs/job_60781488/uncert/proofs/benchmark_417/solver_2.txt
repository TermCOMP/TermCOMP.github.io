----------------------------------------

(6) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   F(f(f(a, x), b), b) -> F(f(x, b), b)
   F(f(f(a, x), b), b) -> F(x, b)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(F(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(a) = 1
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + 2*x_2

   F(f(f(a, x), b), b) -> F(f(a, f(f(x, b), b)), b)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

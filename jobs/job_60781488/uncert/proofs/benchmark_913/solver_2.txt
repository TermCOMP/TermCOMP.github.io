Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(X, X) -> a__f(a, b)
   a__b -> a
   mark(f(X1, X2)) -> a__f(mark(X1), X2)
   mark(b) -> a__b
   mark(a) -> a
   a__f(X1, X2) -> f(X1, X2)
   a__b -> b

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 0
   POL(a__b) = 0
   POL(a__f(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(mark(x_1)) = 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   a__f(X1, X2) -> f(X1, X2)




----------------------------------------

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(X, X) -> a__f(a, b)

   mark(f(X1, X2)) -> a__f(mark(X1), X2)
   mark(b) -> a__b
   mark(a) -> a
   a__b -> b

Q is empty.

   POL(a) = 0
   POL(a__b) = 0

   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(mark(x_1)) = 2*x_1

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   POL(a__f(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2

(9) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   a__f(X, X) -> a__f(a, b)

The signature Sigma is {a__f_2}

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a__f(x0, x0)


----------------------------------------

(11) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A__F(X, X) -> A__F(a, b)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(X, X) -> a__f(a, b)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   a__f(x0, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(13) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)

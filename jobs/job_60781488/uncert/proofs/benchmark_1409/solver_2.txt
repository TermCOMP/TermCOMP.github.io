(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, 0) -> s(0)
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> s(f(x, y))
   g(0, x) -> g(f(x, x), x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is 
   f(x, 0) -> s(0)
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> s(f(x, y))

The TRS R 2 is 
   g(0, x) -> g(f(x, x), x)

The signature Sigma is {g_2}
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, 0) -> s(0)
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> s(f(x, y))
   g(0, x) -> g(f(x, x), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, 0)
   f(s(x0), s(x1))
   g(0, x0)


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), s(y)) -> F(x, y)
   G(0, x) -> G(f(x, x), x)
   G(0, x) -> F(x, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, 0) -> s(0)
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> s(f(x, y))
   g(0, x) -> g(f(x, x), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, 0)
   f(s(x0), s(x1))
   g(0, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), s(y)) -> F(x, y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, 0) -> s(0)
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> s(f(x, y))
   g(0, x) -> g(f(x, x), x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, 0)
   f(s(x0), s(x1))
   g(0, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), s(y)) -> F(x, y)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, 0)
   f(s(x0), s(x1))
   g(0, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(x0, 0)
   f(s(x0), s(x1))
   g(0, x0)


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), s(y)) -> F(x, y)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*F(s(x), s(y)) -> F(x, y)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2


----------------------------------------

(12)
YES

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(y, 0), 0) -> y
   c(c(y)) -> y
   c(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> a(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(a(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(c(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   c(c(y)) -> y




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(y, 0), 0) -> y
   c(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> a(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> A(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)
   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(c(c(a(x, 0))))
   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(c(a(x, 0)))
   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(a(x, 0))
   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> A(x, 0)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(y, 0), 0) -> y
   c(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> a(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(c(a(x, 0)))
   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(c(c(a(x, 0))))
   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(a(x, 0))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(y, 0), 0) -> y
   c(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> a(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(c(a(x, 0)))
   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(a(x, 0))


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(C(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(a(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(c(x_1)) = 1 + x_1


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(c(c(a(x, 0))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(y, 0), 0) -> y
   c(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> a(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> C(c(c(a(x, 0))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(C(x_1)) =  	[[-I]] 	 +  	[[1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a(x_1, x_2)) =  	[[-I]] 	 +  	[[1A]] 	* 	x_1 	 +  	[[4A]] 	* 	x_2
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c(x_1)) =  	[[5A]] 	 +  	[[1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(0) =  	[[0A]]
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   a(a(y, 0), 0) -> y
   c(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> a(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(y, 0), 0) -> y
   c(a(c(c(y)), x)) -> a(c(c(c(a(x, 0)))), y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(12)
YES

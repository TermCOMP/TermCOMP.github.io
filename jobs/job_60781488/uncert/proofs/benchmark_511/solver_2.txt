----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(h(g(x))) -> g(x)
   g(g(x)) -> g(h(g(x)))
   h(h(x)) -> h(f(h(x), x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(g(x)) -> G(h(g(x)))
   G(g(x)) -> H(g(x))
   H(h(x)) -> H(f(h(x), x))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(h(g(x))) -> g(x)
   g(g(x)) -> g(h(g(x)))
   h(h(x)) -> h(f(h(x), x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(g(x)) -> G(h(g(x)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(h(g(x))) -> g(x)
   g(g(x)) -> g(h(g(x)))
   h(h(x)) -> h(f(h(x), x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   G(g(x)) -> G(h(g(x)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
G(x1)  =  x1

g(x1)  =  g

h(x1)  =  h


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

and weight map:

   h=1
   g=2

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   h(h(x)) -> h(f(h(x), x))


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(h(g(x))) -> g(x)
   g(g(x)) -> g(h(g(x)))
   h(h(x)) -> h(f(h(x), x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

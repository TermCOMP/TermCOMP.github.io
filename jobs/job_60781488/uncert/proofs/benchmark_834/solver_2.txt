----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   zeros -> cons(0, zeros)
   tail(cons(X, XS)) -> XS

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(tail(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(zeros) = 2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   tail(cons(X, XS)) -> XS




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   zeros -> cons(0, zeros)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   zeros -> cons(0, zeros)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   zeros


----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   ZEROS -> ZEROS

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   zeros -> cons(0, zeros)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   zeros

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   ZEROS -> ZEROS

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   zeros

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   zeros


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   ZEROS -> ZEROS

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = ZEROS evaluates to  t =ZEROS

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from ZEROS to ZEROS.

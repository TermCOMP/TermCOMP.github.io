Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x)) -> a(c(b(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 0. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(x)) -> a(c(b(x)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
7, 8, 9, 10

Node 7 is start node and node 8 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 7 to 9 labelled a_1(0)* 8 to 8 labelled #_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled c_1(0)* 10 to 8 labelled b_1(0)

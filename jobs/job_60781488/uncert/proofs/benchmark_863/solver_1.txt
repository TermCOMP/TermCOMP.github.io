** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: h(|0|,g(|0|,s(|0|))) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 1] h^#(_0,g(_0,s(_0))) -> h^#(|0|,g(_0,s(_0)))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {_0->|0|} and theta2 = {}.
We have r|p = h^#(|0|,g(_0,s(_0)))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = h(|0|,g(|0|,s(|0|)))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 12

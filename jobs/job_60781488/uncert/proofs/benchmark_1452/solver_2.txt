----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(x, a)) -> f(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(x, a)) -> f(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(a, f(x0, a))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(x, a)) -> F(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))
   F(a, f(x, a)) -> F(f(f(a, a), a), a)
   F(a, f(x, a)) -> F(f(a, a), a)
   F(a, f(x, a)) -> F(a, a)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(x, a)) -> f(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(a, f(x0, a))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 3 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(x, a)) -> F(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(x, a)) -> f(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(a, f(x0, a))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(x, a)) -> F(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(a, f(x0, a))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(a, f(x, a)) -> F(x, f(f(f(a, a), a), a))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial Order [NEGPOLO,POLO] with Interpretation:

POL( F_2(x_1, x_2) ) = x_1 + x_2 + 1
POL( a ) = 2
POL( f_2(x_1, x_2) ) = max{0, x_1 - 1}

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:
none


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(a, f(x0, a))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(12)
YES

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__c -> a__f(g(c))
   a__f(g(X)) -> g(X)
   mark(c) -> a__c
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(X)
   mark(g(X)) -> g(X)
   a__c -> c
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a__c -> a__f(g(c))
   a__f(g(X)) -> g(X)
   mark(c) -> a__c
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(X)
   mark(g(X)) -> g(X)
   a__c -> c
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12

Node 1 is start node and node 3 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled a__f_1(0), f_1(1)* 1 to 3 labelled g_1(0), a__c(0), a__f_1(0), c(0), f_1(0), c(1), f_1(1), g_1(1)* 1 to 11 labelled a__f_1(1), f_1(2)* 1 to 6 labelled g_1(1)* 1 to 12 labelled g_1(2)* 3 to 3 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled g_1(0)* 6 to 3 labelled c(0)* 11 to 12 labelled g_1(1)* 12 to 3 labelled c(1)

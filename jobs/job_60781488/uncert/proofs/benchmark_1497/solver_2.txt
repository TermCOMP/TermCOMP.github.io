Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, a(b(y))) -> f(a(b(x)), y)
   f(a(x), y) -> f(x, a(y))
   f(b(x), y) -> f(x, b(y))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   f(x, a(b(y))) -> f(a(b(x)), y)
   f(a(x), y) -> f(x, a(y))
   f(b(x), y) -> f(x, b(y))

The signature Sigma is {f_2}
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, a(b(y))) -> f(a(b(x)), y)
   f(a(x), y) -> f(x, a(y))
   f(b(x), y) -> f(x, b(y))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, a(b(x1)))
   f(a(x0), x1)
   f(b(x0), x1)


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x, a(b(y))) -> F(a(b(x)), y)
   F(a(x), y) -> F(x, a(y))
   F(b(x), y) -> F(x, b(y))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, a(b(y))) -> f(a(b(x)), y)
   f(a(x), y) -> f(x, a(y))
   f(b(x), y) -> f(x, b(y))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, a(b(x1)))
   f(a(x0), x1)
   f(b(x0), x1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

(7) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(a(x0), x1)
   f(b(x0), x1)

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem.

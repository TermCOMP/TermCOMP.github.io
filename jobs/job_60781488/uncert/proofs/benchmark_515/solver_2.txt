----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x), y) -> f(x, s(s(x)))
   f(x, s(s(y))) -> f(y, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   f(s(x), y) -> f(x, s(s(x)))
   f(x, s(s(y))) -> f(y, x)

The signature Sigma is {f_2}
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x), y) -> f(x, s(s(x)))
   f(x, s(s(y))) -> f(y, x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(s(x0), x1)
   f(x0, s(s(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), y) -> F(x, s(s(x)))
   F(x, s(s(y))) -> F(y, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x), y) -> f(x, s(s(x)))
   f(x, s(s(y))) -> f(y, x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(s(x0), x1)
   f(x0, s(s(x1)))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), y) -> F(x, s(s(x)))
   F(x, s(s(y))) -> F(y, x)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(s(x0), x1)
   f(x0, s(s(x1)))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(s(x0), x1)
   f(x0, s(s(x1)))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x), y) -> F(x, s(s(x)))
   F(x, s(s(y))) -> F(y, x)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(s(x), y) -> F(x, s(s(x)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(F(x_1, x_2)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[3A]] 	* 	x_1 	 +  	[[1A]] 	* 	x_2
>>>

   <<<
 POL(s(x_1)) =  	[[2A]] 	 +  	[[1A]] 	* 	x_1
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:
none


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x, s(s(y))) -> F(y, x)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*F(x, s(s(y))) -> F(y, x)
The graph contains the following edges 2 > 1, 1 >= 2


----------------------------------------

YES

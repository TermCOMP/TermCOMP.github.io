Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(X)) -> mark(g(h(f(X))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   mark(h(X)) -> active(h(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)
   h(mark(X)) -> h(X)
   h(active(X)) -> h(X)

Q is empty.

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(f(X)) -> mark(g(h(f(X))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   mark(h(X)) -> active(h(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)
   h(mark(X)) -> h(X)
   h(active(X)) -> h(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 31

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

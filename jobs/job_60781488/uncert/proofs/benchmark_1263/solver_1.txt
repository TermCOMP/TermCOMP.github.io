NO

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Certificate: U104(tt) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following generalized rule was detected
in the analyzed TRS:
U104(tt) -> plus(x(_0,_1),_0)
Hence, the term U104(tt)
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1

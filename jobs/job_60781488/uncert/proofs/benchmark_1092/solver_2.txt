Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(c) -> mark(f(g(c)))
   active(f(g(X))) -> mark(g(X))
   proper(c) -> ok(c)
   proper(f(X)) -> f(proper(X))
   proper(g(X)) -> g(proper(X))
   f(ok(X)) -> ok(f(X))
   g(ok(X)) -> ok(g(X))
   top(mark(X)) -> top(proper(X))
   top(ok(X)) -> top(active(X))

Q is empty.

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c'(active(x)) -> c'(g(f(mark(x))))
   g(f(active(X))) -> g(mark(X))
   c'(proper(x)) -> c'(ok(x))
   f(proper(X)) -> proper(f(X))
   g(proper(X)) -> proper(g(X))
   ok(f(X)) -> f(ok(X))
   ok(g(X)) -> g(ok(X))
   mark(top(X)) -> proper(top(X))
   ok(top(X)) -> active(top(X))

Q is empty.

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 5. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   c'(active(x)) -> c'(g(f(mark(x))))
   g(f(active(X))) -> g(mark(X))
   c'(proper(x)) -> c'(ok(x))
   f(proper(X)) -> proper(f(X))
   g(proper(X)) -> proper(g(X))
   ok(f(X)) -> f(ok(X))
   ok(g(X)) -> g(ok(X))
   mark(top(X)) -> proper(top(X))
   ok(top(X)) -> active(top(X))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 75, 76, 77, 78, 83, 84, 85, 86

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> cons(0)
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))
   p(s(X)) -> X

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(0) -> cons(0)
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))
   p(s(X)) -> X

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 3 labelled cons_1(0)* 1 to 4 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled f_1(0), 0(0), cons_1(0), s_1(0), p_1(0), f_1(1), 0(1), cons_1(1), s_1(1), p_1(1)* 1 to 13 labelled cons_1(1)* 1 to 14 labelled f_1(1), cons_1(2)* 1 to 1 labelled cons_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 2 labelled 0(0)* 4 to 5 labelled p_1(0)* 4 to 2 labelled 0(1)* 5 to 6 labelled s_1(0)* 6 to 2 labelled 0(0)* 13 to 2 labelled 0(1)* 14 to 15 labelled p_1(1)* 14 to 2 labelled 0(2)* 15 to 16 labelled s_1(1)* 16 to 2 labelled 0(1)

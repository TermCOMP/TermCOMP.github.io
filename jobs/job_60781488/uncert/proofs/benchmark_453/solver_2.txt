Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(x)) -> s(f(f(p(s(x)))))
   f(0) -> 0
   p(s(x)) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   s(f(x)) -> s(p(f(f(s(x)))))
   0'(f(x)) -> 0'(x)
   s(p(x)) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   s(f(x)) -> s(p(f(f(s(x)))))
   0'(f(x)) -> 0'(x)
   s(p(x)) -> x

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

Node 7 is start node and node 8 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 7 to 9 labelled s_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled 0'_1(0), s_1(0), f_1(0), p_1(0), 0'_1(1), s_1(1), f_1(1), p_1(1)* 7 to 13 labelled s_1(1)* 7 to 11 labelled f_1(1)* 7 to 15 labelled f_1(2)* 8 to 8 labelled #_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled p_1(0)* 10 to 11 labelled f_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled f_1(0)* 12 to 8 labelled s_1(0), s_1(1), f_1(1), p_1(1), 0'_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled s_1(1)* 12 to 15 labelled f_1(2)* 13 to 14 labelled p_1(1)* 14 to 15 labelled f_1(1)* 15 to 16 labelled f_1(1)* 16 to 8 labelled s_1(1), f_1(1), p_1(1), 0'_1(1)* 16 to 13 labelled s_1(1)* 16 to 15 labelled f_1(2)

Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x)
(RULES
a(b(x)) -> b(a(x))
a(c(x)) -> x
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 a(b(x)) -> b(a(x))
 a(c(x)) -> x
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))
   f(c(s(x), y)) -> f(c(x, s(y)))
   f(f(x)) -> f(d(f(x)))
   f(x) -> x

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(c(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(d(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(f(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x) -> x




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:

   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))

   f(f(x)) -> f(d(f(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(c(x, s(y))) -> G(c(s(x), y))
   F(c(s(x), y)) -> F(c(x, s(y)))
   F(f(x)) -> F(d(f(x)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(c(x, s(y))) -> g(c(s(x), y))
   f(c(s(x), y)) -> f(c(x, s(y)))
   f(f(x)) -> f(d(f(x)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

Q is empty.

   f(c(s(x0), x1))
   f(f(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(10) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

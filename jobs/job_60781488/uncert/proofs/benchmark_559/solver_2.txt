Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a) -> f(c(a))
   f(c(X)) -> X
   f(c(a)) -> f(d(b))
   f(a) -> f(d(a))
   f(d(X)) -> X
   f(c(b)) -> f(d(a))
   e(g(X)) -> e(X)

Q is empty.

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(a) -> f(c(a))
   f(c(X)) -> X
   f(c(a)) -> f(d(b))
   f(a) -> f(d(a))
   f(d(X)) -> X
   f(c(b)) -> f(d(a))
   e(g(X)) -> e(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 9 labelled f_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled f_1(0), a(0), c_1(0), d_1(0), b(0), e_1(0), g_1(0), f_1(1), a(1), c_1(1), d_1(1), b(1), e_1(1), g_1(1), a(2), b(2), b(3)* 3 to 11 labelled f_1(0)* 3 to 21 labelled f_1(1)* 3 to 23 labelled f_1(1)* 3 to 25 labelled f_1(2)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled c_1(0)* 10 to 4 labelled a(0)* 11 to 12 labelled d_1(0)* 12 to 4 labelled b(0), a(0)* 21 to 22 labelled c_1(1)* 22 to 4 labelled a(1)* 23 to 24 labelled d_1(1)* 24 to 4 labelled b(1), a(1)* 25 to 26 labelled d_1(2)* 26 to 4 labelled b(2)

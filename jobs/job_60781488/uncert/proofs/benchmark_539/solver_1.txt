* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18 + JAR'24 + LOPSTR'25]
* Certificate: f(h(|0|),h(|0|)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following recurrent pair was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS [iteration = 1]:
u1 -> v1 = f^#(_0,g(_1,_1)) -> f^#(g(_0,_0),_1)
u2 -> v2 = f^#(_2,h(|0|)) -> f^#(g(h(|0|),h(|0|)),_2)
We have:
u1 = c1[x,c2^m1[y]], v1 = c1[c2^n1[x],c2^n2[y]]
u2 = c1[x,c2^m2[s]], v2 = c1[c2^n3[t],c2^n4[x]]
for:
c1 = f^#(□,□')
c2 = g(□,□)
s = t = h(|0|)
(m1,m2) = (1,0) and (n1,n2,n3,n4) = (1,0,1,0)
So, the term c1[s,c2^m2[s]] = f(h(|0|),h(|0|))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.

Total number of generated unfolded rules = 6

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS
(1) NonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 52 ms]
(2) NO

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(L(x)) -> L(a(x))
   R(a(x)) -> a(R(x))
   b(L(x)) -> b(R(x))
   R(b(x)) -> L(a(b(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"b R (a)^k b -> b R (a)^k+1 b"
b R (a)^k b -> b R (a)^k+1 b

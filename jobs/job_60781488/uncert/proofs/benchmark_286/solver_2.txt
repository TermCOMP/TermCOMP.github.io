Q restricted rewrite system:

----------------------------------------

(1) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is 
   h(f(0, y)) -> tt
   f(s(x), y) -> f(x, s(y))

The TRS R 2 is 
   g(tt, x) -> g(h(f(x, x)), s(x))

The signature Sigma is {g_2}

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(tt, x0)
   h(f(0, x0))
   f(s(x0), x1)


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(tt, x) -> G(h(f(x, x)), s(x))
   G(tt, x) -> H(f(x, x))
   G(tt, x) -> F(x, x)
   F(s(x), y) -> F(x, s(y))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(tt, x) -> g(h(f(x, x)), s(x))
   h(f(0, y)) -> tt
   f(s(x), y) -> f(x, s(y))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(tt, x0)
   h(f(0, x0))
   f(s(x0), x1)

----------------------------------------

(8) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

----------------------------------------

(10) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem.

*F(s(x), y) -> F(x, s(y))

----------------------------------------

(17) NonLoopProof (COMPLETE)
By Theorem 8 [NONLOOP] we deduce infiniteness of the QDP.
We apply the theorem with m = 1, b = 1, 
?' = [ ], and ?' = [ ] on the rule
G(tt, s(zr0))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0] -> G(tt, s(s(zr0)))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0]
This rule is correct for the QDP as the following derivation shows:

G(tt, s(zr0))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0] -> G(tt, s(s(zr0)))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0]

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(f(g(f(a))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(X))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(f(g(f(a))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(X))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 29 labelled mark_1(0)* 3 to 33 labelled active_1(0)* 3 to 32 labelled active_1(0)* 3 to 34 labelled active_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled f_1(0), g_1(0), f_1(1), g_1(1)* 3 to 36 labelled active_1(1)* 3 to 39 labelled mark_1(1)* 3 to 43 labelled active_1(2)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 29 to 30 labelled f_1(0)* 30 to 31 labelled g_1(0)* 31 to 32 labelled f_1(0)* 32 to 4 labelled a(0)* 33 to 4 labelled f_1(0), f_1(1), a(1)* 34 to 35 labelled g_1(0)* 34 to 4 labelled g_1(1)* 34 to 33 labelled g_1(1)* 34 to 37 labelled g_1(1)* 34 to 39 labelled g_1(1)* 34 to 43 labelled g_1(1)* 35 to 4 labelled mark_1(0)* 35 to 33 labelled active_1(1)* 35 to 37 labelled active_1(1)* 35 to 39 labelled mark_1(1)* 35 to 43 labelled active_1(2)* 36 to 30 labelled f_1(1)* 37 to 38 labelled g_1(1)* 37 to 4 labelled g_1(2), g_1(1)* 37 to 33 labelled g_1(2)* 37 to 37 labelled g_1(2)* 37 to 39 labelled g_1(2)* 37 to 43 labelled g_1(2)* 38 to 4 labelled mark_1(1)* 38 to 33 labelled active_1(1)* 38 to 37 labelled active_1(1)* 38 to 39 labelled mark_1(1)* 38 to 43 labelled active_1(2)* 39 to 40 labelled f_1(1)* 40 to 41 labelled g_1(1)* 41 to 42 labelled f_1(1)* 42 to 4 labelled a(1)* 43 to 40 labelled f_1(2)

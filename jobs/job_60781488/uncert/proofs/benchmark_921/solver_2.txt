Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(a)) -> f(g(n__f(a)))
   f(X) -> n__f(X)
   activate(n__f(X)) -> f(X)
   activate(X) -> X

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a'(f(f(x))) -> a'(n__f(g(f(x))))
   f(X) -> n__f(X)
   n__f(activate(X)) -> f(X)
   activate(X) -> X

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a'(f(f(x))) -> a'(n__f(g(f(x))))
   f(X) -> n__f(X)
   n__f(activate(X)) -> f(X)
   activate(X) -> X

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled a'_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled n__f_1(0), f_1(0), a'_1(0), g_1(0), activate_1(0), n__f_1(1), f_1(1), a'_1(1), g_1(1), activate_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 1 to 11 labelled a'_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled n__f_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled g_1(0)* 7 to 2 labelled f_1(0), n__f_1(1), f_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 11 to 12 labelled n__f_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled g_1(1)* 13 to 2 labelled f_1(1), n__f_1(2)

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(y, f(h(h(x)), a))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(y, f(h(h(x)), a))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

   H(f(x, y)) -> H(h(x))
   H(f(x, y)) -> H(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(y, f(h(h(x)), a))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By narrowing [LPAR04] the rule H(f(x, y)) -> H(h(x)) at position [0] we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (H(f(f(x0, x1), y1)) -> H(f(x1, f(h(h(x0)), a))),H(f(f(x0, x1), y1)) -> H(f(x1, f(h(h(x0)), a))))


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:

----------------------------------------

(7) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By forward instantiating [JAR06] the rule H(f(x, y)) -> H(x) we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (H(f(f(y_0, y_1), x1)) -> H(f(y_0, y_1)),H(f(f(y_0, y_1), x1)) -> H(f(y_0, y_1)))
   (H(f(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2), x1)) -> H(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2)),H(f(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2), x1)) -> H(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2)))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(f(x0, x1), y1)) -> H(f(x1, f(h(h(x0)), a)))
   H(f(f(y_0, y_1), x1)) -> H(f(y_0, y_1))
   H(f(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2), x1)) -> H(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(y, f(h(h(x)), a))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   H(f(f(x0, x1), y1)) -> H(f(x1, f(h(h(x0)), a)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(H(x_1)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[-I, 0A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(f(x_1, x_2)) =  	[[1A], [-I], [-I]] 	 +  	[[-I, -I, 0A], [0A, 0A, 1A], [-I, -I, 0A]] 	* 	x_1 	 +  	[[-I, -I, 0A], [-I, -I, -I], [0A, 0A, 1A]] 	* 	x_2
>>>

   <<<
 POL(h(x_1)) =  	[[-I], [-I], [-I]] 	 +  	[[0A, 0A, 0A], [-I, -I, 0A], [0A, 1A, -I]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a) =  	[[0A], [0A], [-I]]
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(y, f(h(h(x)), a))

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(f(y_0, y_1), x1)) -> H(f(y_0, y_1))
   H(f(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2), x1)) -> H(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x, y)) -> f(y, f(h(h(x)), a))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(12)

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(f(y_0, y_1), x1)) -> H(f(y_0, y_1))
   H(f(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2), x1)) -> H(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2))

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0, x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   h(f(x0, x1))


----------------------------------------

(14)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2), x1)) -> H(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2))

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(15) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*H(f(f(y_0, y_1), x1)) -> H(f(y_0, y_1))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1


*H(f(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2), x1)) -> H(f(f(y_0, y_1), y_2))
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) Strip Symbols Proof [SOUND, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> g(f(x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Strip Symbols Proof (SOUND)
We were given the following TRS:

   f(f(x)) -> g(f(x))

By stripping symbols from the only rule of the system, we obtained the following TRS [ENDRULLIS]: 

   f(x) -> g(x)

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x) -> g(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 0. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(x) -> g(x)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 2 labelled g_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)

(4)
YES

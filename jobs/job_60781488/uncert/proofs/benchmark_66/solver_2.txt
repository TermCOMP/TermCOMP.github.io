Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 29 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(app(uncurry, f), x), y) -> app(app(f, x), y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(app(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(uncurry) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   app(app(app(uncurry, f), x), y) -> app(app(f, x), y)




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(4)
YES

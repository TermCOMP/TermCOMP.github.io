* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: app(app(_0,|0|),_1) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 0] app^#(app(_0,|0|),_1) -> app^#(app(cons,|0|),nil)
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {} and theta2 = {_1->nil, _0->cons}.
We have r|p = app^#(app(cons,|0|),nil)
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = app(app(_0,|0|),_1)
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 9

YES

Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty)
(RULES
c -> f
f -> g
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 c -> f
 f -> g
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 C -> F
-> Rules:

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:

(19) NonInfProof (EQUIVALENT)
The DP Problem is simplified using the Induction Calculus [NONINF] with the following steps:

Note that final constraints are written in bold face.



For Pair MINUS(x, y) -> HELP(lt(y, x), x, y) the following chains were created:
*We consider the chain HELP(true, x2, x3) -> MINUS(x2, s(x3)), MINUS(x4, x5) -> HELP(lt(x5, x4), x4, x5) which results in the following constraint:

(1)    (MINUS(x2, s(x3))=MINUS(x4, x5)  ==>  MINUS(x4, x5)_>=_HELP(lt(x5, x4), x4, x5))



We simplified constraint (1) using rules (I), (II), (III) which results in the following new constraint:

(2)    (MINUS(x2, s(x3))_>=_HELP(lt(s(x3), x2), x2, s(x3)))








For Pair HELP(true, x, y) -> MINUS(x, s(y)) the following chains were created:
*We consider the chain MINUS(x6, x7) -> HELP(lt(x7, x6), x6, x7), HELP(true, x8, x9) -> MINUS(x8, s(x9)) which results in the following constraint:

(1)    (HELP(lt(x7, x6), x6, x7)=HELP(true, x8, x9)  ==>  HELP(true, x8, x9)_>=_MINUS(x8, s(x9)))



We simplified constraint (1) using rules (I), (II), (III) which results in the following new constraint:

(2)    (lt(x7, x6)=true  ==>  HELP(true, x6, x7)_>=_MINUS(x6, s(x7)))



We simplified constraint (2) using rule (V) (with possible (I) afterwards) using induction on lt(x7, x6)=true which results in the following new constraints:

(3)    (true=true  ==>  HELP(true, s(x12), 0)_>=_MINUS(s(x12), s(0)))

(4)    (lt(x15, x14)=true & (lt(x15, x14)=true  ==>  HELP(true, x14, x15)_>=_MINUS(x14, s(x15)))  ==>  HELP(true, s(x14), s(x15))_>=_MINUS(s(x14), s(s(x15))))



We simplified constraint (3) using rules (I), (II) which results in the following new constraint:

(5)    (HELP(true, s(x12), 0)_>=_MINUS(s(x12), s(0)))



We simplified constraint (4) using rule (VI) where we applied the induction hypothesis (lt(x15, x14)=true  ==>  HELP(true, x14, x15)_>=_MINUS(x14, s(x15))) with sigma = [ ] which results in the following new constraint:

(6)    (HELP(true, x14, x15)_>=_MINUS(x14, s(x15))  ==>  HELP(true, s(x14), s(x15))_>=_MINUS(s(x14), s(s(x15))))








To summarize, we get the following constraints P__>=_ for the following pairs.

*MINUS(x, y) -> HELP(lt(y, x), x, y)

*(MINUS(x2, s(x3))_>=_HELP(lt(s(x3), x2), x2, s(x3)))




*HELP(true, x, y) -> MINUS(x, s(y))

*(HELP(true, s(x12), 0)_>=_MINUS(s(x12), s(0)))


*(HELP(true, x14, x15)_>=_MINUS(x14, s(x15))  ==>  HELP(true, s(x14), s(x15))_>=_MINUS(s(x14), s(s(x15))))








The constraints for P_> respective P_bound are constructed from P__>=_ where we just replace every occurence of "t _>=_ s" in P__>=_ by  "t > s" respective "t _>=_ c". Here c stands for the fresh constant used for P_bound. 

Using the following integer polynomial ordering the  resulting constraints can be solved 

Polynomial interpretation [NONINF]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(HELP(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = -x_1 + x_2 - x_3
   POL(MINUS(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 - x_2
   POL(c) = -1
   POL(false) = 0
   POL(lt(x_1, x_2)) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(true) = 0


The following pairs  are in P_>:
   MINUS(x, y) -> HELP(lt(y, x), x, y)
The following pairs are in P_bound:
   HELP(true, x, y) -> MINUS(x, s(y))
The following rules are usable:
   true -> lt(0, s(x))
   false -> lt(x, 0)
   lt(x, y) -> lt(s(x), s(y))

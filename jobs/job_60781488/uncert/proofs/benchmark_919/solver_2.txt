Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(f(g(f(a))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 4. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(f(g(f(a))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52, 57

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

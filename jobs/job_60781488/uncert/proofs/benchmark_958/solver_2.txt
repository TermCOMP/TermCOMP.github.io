Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(f(a)) -> c(f(g(f(a))))
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(mark(X))
   mark(a) -> a
   mark(c(X)) -> c(X)
   mark(g(X)) -> g(mark(X))
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a__f(f(a)) -> c(f(g(f(a))))
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(mark(X))
   mark(a) -> a
   mark(c(X)) -> c(X)
   mark(g(X)) -> g(mark(X))
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Node 2 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 2 to 5 labelled c_1(0)* 2 to 9 labelled a__f_1(0), g_1(0), f_1(1)* 2 to 4 labelled a(0), c_1(0), f_1(0)* 2 to 11 labelled c_1(1)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled f_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled g_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled f_1(0)* 8 to 4 labelled a(0)* 9 to 4 labelled mark_1(0), a(1), c_1(1)* 9 to 10 labelled a__f_1(1), g_1(1), f_1(2)* 9 to 15 labelled c_1(2)* 10 to 4 labelled mark_1(1), a(1), c_1(1)* 10 to 10 labelled a__f_1(1), g_1(1), f_1(2)* 10 to 15 labelled c_1(2)* 11 to 12 labelled f_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled g_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled f_1(1)* 14 to 4 labelled a(1)* 15 to 16 labelled f_1(2)* 16 to 17 labelled g_1(2)* 17 to 18 labelled f_1(2)* 18 to 4 labelled a(2)

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))
   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(f(a, x), f(a, a))
   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(a, a)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(a, f(a, x)) -> F(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO,RATPOLO]:

   POL(F(x_1, x_2)) = [1/4]x_2
   POL(a) = [1/2]
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = [1/2]x_1
The value of delta used in the strict ordering is 1/32.
The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, f(a, x)) -> f(a, f(f(a, x), f(a, a)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

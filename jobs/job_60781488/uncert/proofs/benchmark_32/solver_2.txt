Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> f(c(f(x)))
   f(f(x)) -> f(d(f(x)))
   g(c(x)) -> x
   g(d(x)) -> x
   g(c(h(0))) -> g(d(1))
   g(c(1)) -> g(d(h(0)))
   g(h(x)) -> g(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(x)) -> f(c(f(x)))
   f(f(x)) -> f(d(f(x)))
   g(c(x)) -> x
   g(d(x)) -> x
   g(c(h(0))) -> g(d(1))
   g(c(1)) -> g(d(h(0)))
   g(h(x)) -> g(x)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 7 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled f_1(0), c_1(0), d_1(0), g_1(0), h_1(0), 0(0), 1(0), f_1(1), c_1(1), d_1(1), g_1(1), h_1(1), 0(1), 1(1), 1(2)* 1 to 9 labelled g_1(0)* 1 to 11 labelled g_1(0)* 1 to 23 labelled f_1(1)* 1 to 25 labelled f_1(1)* 1 to 27 labelled g_1(1)* 1 to 29 labelled g_1(1)* 1 to 13 labelled h_1(1)* 1 to 31 labelled h_1(2)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled c_1(0)* 6 to 2 labelled f_1(0)* 6 to 23 labelled f_1(1)* 6 to 25 labelled f_1(1)* 7 to 8 labelled d_1(0)* 8 to 2 labelled f_1(0)* 8 to 23 labelled f_1(1)* 8 to 25 labelled f_1(1)* 9 to 10 labelled d_1(0)* 10 to 2 labelled 1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled d_1(0)* 12 to 13 labelled h_1(0)* 13 to 2 labelled 0(0)* 23 to 24 labelled c_1(1)* 24 to 2 labelled f_1(1)* 24 to 23 labelled f_1(1)* 24 to 25 labelled f_1(1)* 25 to 26 labelled d_1(1)* 26 to 2 labelled f_1(1)* 26 to 23 labelled f_1(1)* 26 to 25 labelled f_1(1)* 27 to 28 labelled d_1(1)* 28 to 2 labelled 1(1)* 29 to 30 labelled d_1(1)* 30 to 31 labelled h_1(1)* 31 to 2 labelled 0(1)

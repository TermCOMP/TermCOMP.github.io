Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x), ys) -> app(app(cons, x), ys)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x), ys) -> ys
   app(app(filter, f), nil) -> nil
   app(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> app(app(app(consif, app(f, x)), x), app(app(filter, f), xs))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x), ys) -> app(app(cons, x), ys)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x), ys) -> ys
   app(app(filter, f), nil) -> nil
   app(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> app(app(app(consif, app(f, x)), x), app(app(filter, f), xs))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x0), x1)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x0), x1)
   app(app(filter, x0), nil)
   app(app(filter, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   APP(app(app(consif, true), x), ys) -> APP(app(cons, x), ys)
   APP(app(app(consif, true), x), ys) -> APP(cons, x)
   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(app(consif, app(f, x)), x), app(app(filter, f), xs))
   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(consif, app(f, x)), x)
   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(consif, app(f, x))
   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x), ys) -> app(app(cons, x), ys)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x), ys) -> ys
   app(app(filter, f), nil) -> nil
   app(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> app(app(app(consif, app(f, x)), x), app(app(filter, f), xs))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x0), x1)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x0), x1)
   app(app(filter, x0), nil)
   app(app(filter, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 5 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)
   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x), ys) -> app(app(cons, x), ys)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x), ys) -> ys
   app(app(filter, f), nil) -> nil
   app(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> app(app(app(consif, app(f, x)), x), app(app(filter, f), xs))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x0), x1)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x0), x1)
   app(app(filter, x0), nil)
   app(app(filter, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)
   APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   app(app(app(consif, true), x0), x1)
   app(app(app(consif, false), x0), x1)
   app(app(filter, x0), nil)
   app(app(filter, x0), app(app(cons, x1), x2))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(app(filter, f), xs)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*APP(app(filter, f), app(app(cons, x), xs)) -> APP(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 > 2

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   w(r(x)) -> r(w(x))
   b(r(x)) -> r(b(x))
   b(w(x)) -> w(b(x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   W(r(x)) -> W(x)
   B(r(x)) -> B(x)
   B(w(x)) -> W(b(x))
   B(w(x)) -> B(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   w(r(x)) -> r(w(x))
   b(r(x)) -> r(b(x))
   b(w(x)) -> w(b(x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Complex Obligation (AND)

----------------------------------------

(5)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   W(r(x)) -> W(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   w(r(x)) -> r(w(x))
   b(r(x)) -> r(b(x))
   b(w(x)) -> w(b(x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(6) MNOCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the modular non-overlap check [LPAR04] to enlarge Q to all left-hand sides of R.
----------------------------------------

(7)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   W(r(x)) -> W(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   w(r(x)) -> r(w(x))
   b(r(x)) -> r(b(x))
   b(w(x)) -> w(b(x))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   w(r(x0))
   b(r(x0))
   b(w(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(8) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

   b(w(x0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(10) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   w(r(x0))
   b(r(x0))
   b(w(x0))

(12) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:

----------------------------------------

(15) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

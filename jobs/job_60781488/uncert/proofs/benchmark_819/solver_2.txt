----------------------------------------

(30) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = INF(s(s(z0))) evaluates to  t =INF(s(s(s(z0))))

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [z0 / s(z0)]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from INF(s(s(z0))) to INF(s(s(s(z0)))).

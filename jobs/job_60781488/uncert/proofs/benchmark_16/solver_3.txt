Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y)
(RULES
f(s(x),y,y) -> f(y,x,s(x))
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(s(x),y,y) -> f(y,x,s(x))
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(s(x),y,y) -> F(y,x,s(x))
-> Rules:
 f(s(x),y,y) -> f(y,x,s(x))

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(s(x),y,y) -> F(y,x,s(x))
-> Rules:
 f(s(x),y,y) -> f(y,x,s(x))
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

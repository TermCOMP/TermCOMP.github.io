* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: f(c,n__g(c),n__g(b)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 7] f^#(c,n__g(c),n__g(b)) -> f^#(c,n__g(c),n__g(b))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {} and theta2 = {}.
We have r|p = f^#(c,n__g(c),n__g(b))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = f(c,n__g(c),n__g(b))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 524

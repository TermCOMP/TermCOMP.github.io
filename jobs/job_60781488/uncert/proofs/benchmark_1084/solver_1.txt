NO

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Certificate: sel(s(_0),cons(_1)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following generalized rule was detected
in the analyzed TRS:
sel(s(_0),cons(_1)) -> sel(_0,_2)
Hence, the term sel(s(_0),cons(_1))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1

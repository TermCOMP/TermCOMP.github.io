Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty X Y)
(RULES
first(num0,X) -> nil
first(s(X),cons(Y)) -> cons(Y)
from(X) -> cons(X)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 first(num0,X) -> nil
 first(s(X),cons(Y)) -> cons(Y)
 from(X) -> cons(X)
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 first(num0,X) -> nil
 first(s(X),cons(Y)) -> cons(Y)
 from(X) -> cons(X)

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 Empty
-> Rules:
 first(num0,X) -> nil
 first(s(X),cons(Y)) -> cons(Y)
 from(X) -> cons(X)
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

(RULES
f(g(x,y),f(y,y)) -> f(g(y,x),y)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(g(x,y),f(y,y)) -> f(g(y,x),y)
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(g(x,y),f(y,y)) -> F(g(y,x),y)
-> Rules:
 f(g(x,y),f(y,y)) -> f(g(y,x),y)

Problem 1:

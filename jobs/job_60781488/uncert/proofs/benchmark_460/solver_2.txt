----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(f(x), y) -> f(h(x, y))
   h(x, y) -> g(x, f(y))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(f(x), y) -> f(h(x, y))
   h(x, y) -> g(x, f(y))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(f(x0), x1)
   h(x0, x1)


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(f(x), y) -> H(x, y)
   H(x, y) -> G(x, f(y))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(f(x), y) -> f(h(x, y))
   h(x, y) -> g(x, f(y))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(f(x0), x1)
   h(x0, x1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(f(x), y) -> H(x, y)
   H(x, y) -> G(x, f(y))

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   g(f(x0), x1)
   h(x0, x1)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   g(f(x0), x1)
   h(x0, x1)


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   G(f(x), y) -> H(x, y)
   H(x, y) -> G(x, f(y))

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*H(x, y) -> G(x, f(y))
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1


*G(f(x), y) -> H(x, y)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1, 2 >= 2


----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(h(x)) -> f(i(x))
   g(i(x)) -> g(h(x))
   h(a) -> b
   i(a) -> b

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(h(x)) -> f(i(x))
   g(i(x)) -> g(h(x))
   h(a) -> b
   i(a) -> b

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 6 labelled g_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled b(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 2 labelled i_1(0), b(1)* 6 to 2 labelled h_1(0), b(1)

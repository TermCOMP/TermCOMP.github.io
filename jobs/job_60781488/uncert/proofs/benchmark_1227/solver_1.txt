NO

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Certificate: U14(tt) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following generalized rule was detected
in the analyzed TRS:
U14(tt) -> snd(splitAt(_0,_1))
Hence, the term U14(tt)
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1

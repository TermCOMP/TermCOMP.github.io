Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a__f(f(a)) -> a__f(g(f(a)))
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(mark(X))
   mark(a) -> a
   mark(g(X)) -> g(X)
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a__f(f(a)) -> a__f(g(f(a)))
   mark(f(X)) -> a__f(mark(X))
   mark(a) -> a
   mark(g(X)) -> g(X)
   a__f(X) -> f(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 3 labelled a__f_1(0), f_1(1)* 1 to 2 labelled a(0), g_1(0), f_1(0)* 1 to 12 labelled a__f_1(1), f_1(2)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled g_1(0)* 3 to 2 labelled mark_1(0), a(1), g_1(1)* 3 to 11 labelled a__f_1(1), f_1(2)* 3 to 15 labelled a__f_1(2), f_1(3)* 4 to 5 labelled f_1(0)* 5 to 2 labelled a(0)* 11 to 2 labelled mark_1(1), a(1), g_1(1)* 11 to 11 labelled a__f_1(1), f_1(2)* 11 to 15 labelled a__f_1(2), f_1(3)* 12 to 13 labelled g_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled f_1(1)* 14 to 2 labelled a(1)* 15 to 16 labelled g_1(2)* 16 to 17 labelled f_1(2)* 17 to 2 labelled a(2)

* Certificate: while(true,s(s(|0|)),s(s(_2))) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following pattern rule was generated by the strategy
presented in Sect. 3 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]:
[iteration = 3] while(true,s(_0),s(_1)){_0->s(_0), _1->s(_1)}^n{_0->s(|0|), _1->s(_2)} -> while(true,s(s(_0)),s(s(_1))){_0->s(_0), _1->s(_1)}^n{_0->s(|0|), _1->s(_2)}
We apply Theorem 8 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]
on this rule with m = 1, b = 1, pi = epsilon,
sigma' = {} and mu' = {}.
Hence the term while(true,s(s(|0|)),s(s(_2))), obtained from
instantiating n with 0 in the left-hand side of
the rule, starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 421

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS
(1) DependencyPairsProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QDP
(3) NonTerminationLoopProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(4) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, b, X) -> f(X, X, X)
   c -> a
   c -> b

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(a, b, X) -> F(X, X, X)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a, b, X) -> f(X, X, X)
   c -> a
   c -> b

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by narrowing to the left:

s = F(c, c, X) evaluates to  t =F(X, X, X)

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [X / c]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

F(c, c, c) -> F(c, b, c)
with rule c -> b at position [1] and matcher [ ]

F(c, b, c) -> F(a, b, c)
with rule c -> a at position [0] and matcher [ ]

F(a, b, c) -> F(c, c, c)
with rule F(a, b, X) -> F(X, X, X)

Now applying the matcher to the start term leads to a term which is equal to the last term in the rewriting sequence


All these steps are and every following step will be a correct step w.r.t to Q.

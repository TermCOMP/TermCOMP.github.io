Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS
(1) DependencyPairsProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QDP
(3) NonTerminationLoopProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(4) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x, y) -> f(x, y, x)
   f(0, 1, x) -> h(x, x)
   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(x, y) -> F(x, y, x)
   F(0, 1, x) -> H(x, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(x, y) -> f(x, y, x)
   f(0, 1, x) -> h(x, x)
   g(x, y) -> x
   g(x, y) -> y

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by narrowing to the left:

s = F(g(0, y), g(x, 1), x') evaluates to  t =F(x', x', x')

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [y / 1, x / 0, x' / g(0, 1)]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

F(g(0, 1), g(0, 1), g(0, 1)) -> F(g(0, 1), 1, g(0, 1))
with rule g(x, y') -> y' at position [1] and matcher [x / 0, y' / 1]

F(g(0, 1), 1, g(0, 1)) -> F(0, 1, g(0, 1))
with rule g(x, y) -> x at position [0] and matcher [x / 0, y / 1]

F(0, 1, g(0, 1)) -> H(g(0, 1), g(0, 1))
with rule F(0, 1, x') -> H(x', x') at position [] and matcher [x' / g(0, 1)]

H(g(0, 1), g(0, 1)) -> F(g(0, 1), g(0, 1), g(0, 1))
with rule H(x, y) -> F(x, y, x)

Now applying the matcher to the start term leads to a term which is equal to the last term in the rewriting sequence


All these steps are and every following step will be a correct step w.r.t to Q.

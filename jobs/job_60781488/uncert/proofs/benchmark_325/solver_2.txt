Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> f(c(f(x)))
   f(f(x)) -> f(d(f(x)))
   g(c(x)) -> x
   g(d(x)) -> x
   g(c(0)) -> g(d(1))
   g(c(1)) -> g(d(0))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(x)) -> f(c(f(x)))
   f(f(x)) -> f(d(f(x)))
   g(c(x)) -> x
   g(d(x)) -> x
   g(c(0)) -> g(d(1))
   g(c(1)) -> g(d(0))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 11 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 13 labelled f_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled f_1(0), c_1(0), d_1(0), g_1(0), 0(0), 1(0), f_1(1), c_1(1), d_1(1), g_1(1), 0(1), 1(1), 1(2), 0(2)* 1 to 15 labelled g_1(0)* 1 to 17 labelled f_1(1)* 1 to 21 labelled f_1(1)* 1 to 23 labelled g_1(1)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 11 to 12 labelled c_1(0)* 12 to 2 labelled f_1(0)* 12 to 17 labelled f_1(1)* 12 to 21 labelled f_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled d_1(0)* 14 to 2 labelled f_1(0)* 14 to 17 labelled f_1(1)* 14 to 21 labelled f_1(1)* 15 to 16 labelled d_1(0)* 16 to 2 labelled 1(0), 0(0)* 17 to 18 labelled c_1(1)* 18 to 2 labelled f_1(1)* 18 to 17 labelled f_1(1)* 18 to 21 labelled f_1(1)* 21 to 22 labelled d_1(1)* 22 to 2 labelled f_1(1)* 22 to 17 labelled f_1(1)* 22 to 21 labelled f_1(1)* 23 to 24 labelled d_1(1)* 24 to 2 labelled 1(1), 0(1)

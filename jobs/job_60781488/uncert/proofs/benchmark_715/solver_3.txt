Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y)
(RULES
f(x,g(x)) -> x
f(x,h(y)) -> f(h(x),y)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(x,g(x)) -> x
 f(x,h(y)) -> f(h(x),y)
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.

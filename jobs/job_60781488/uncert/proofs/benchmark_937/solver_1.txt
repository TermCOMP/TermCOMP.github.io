** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: active(f(active(c),mark(b),active(c))) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 7] active^#(f(active(c),mark(b),active(c))) -> active^#(f(active(c),mark(b),active(c)))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {} and theta2 = {}.
We have r|p = active^#(f(active(c),mark(b),active(c)))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = active(f(active(c),mark(b),active(c)))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.

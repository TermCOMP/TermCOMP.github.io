Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   nats -> adx(zeros)
   zeros -> cons(0, zeros)
   incr(cons(X, Y)) -> cons(s(X), incr(Y))
   adx(cons(X, Y)) -> incr(cons(X, adx(Y)))
   hd(cons(X, Y)) -> X
   tl(cons(X, Y)) -> Y

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(adx(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(hd(x_1)) = 2*x_1

   POL(nats) = 2
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(tl(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(zeros) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

----------------------------------------

(32) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by semiunifying a rule from P directly.

s = ZEROS evaluates to  t =ZEROS

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

The DP semiunifies directly so there is only one rewrite step from ZEROS to ZEROS.

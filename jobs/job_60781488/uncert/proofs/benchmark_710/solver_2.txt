Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS

(2) YES

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(b(x)) -> b(b(a(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(b(x)) -> b(b(a(x)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 3 labelled b_1(0)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled b_1(0)* 4 to 2 labelled a_1(0)* 4 to 9 labelled b_1(1)* 9 to 10 labelled b_1(1)* 10 to 2 labelled a_1(1)* 10 to 9 labelled b_1(1)

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(tt, x) -> f(isNat(x), s(s(x)))
   isNat(s(x)) -> isNat(x)
   isNat(0) -> tt

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is 
   isNat(s(x)) -> isNat(x)
   isNat(0) -> tt

The TRS R 2 is 
   f(tt, x) -> f(isNat(x), s(s(x)))

The signature Sigma is {f_2}
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(tt, x) -> f(isNat(x), s(s(x)))
   isNat(s(x)) -> isNat(x)
   isNat(0) -> tt

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(tt, x0)
   isNat(s(x0))
   isNat(0)


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(tt, x) -> F(isNat(x), s(s(x)))
   F(tt, x) -> ISNAT(x)
   ISNAT(s(x)) -> ISNAT(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(tt, x) -> f(isNat(x), s(s(x)))
   isNat(s(x)) -> isNat(x)
   isNat(0) -> tt

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(tt, x0)
   isNat(s(x0))
   isNat(0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(6)

----------------------------------------

(7)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   ISNAT(s(x)) -> ISNAT(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(tt, x) -> f(isNat(x), s(s(x)))
   isNat(s(x)) -> isNat(x)
   isNat(0) -> tt

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(tt, x0)
   isNat(s(x0))
   isNat(0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(8) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

   ISNAT(s(x)) -> ISNAT(x)

   isNat(s(x0))
   isNat(0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(10) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(tt, x0)
   isNat(s(x0))
   isNat(0)


----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

(12) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*ISNAT(s(x)) -> ISNAT(x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

   isNat(s(x)) -> isNat(x)
   isNat(0) -> tt

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(tt, x0)
   isNat(s(x0))
   isNat(0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(15) MNOCProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the modular non-overlap check [FROCOS05] to decrease Q to the empty set.
----------------------------------------

   isNat(s(x)) -> isNat(x)
   isNat(0) -> tt

We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(17) NonLoopProof (COMPLETE)
By Theorem 8 [NONLOOP] we deduce infiniteness of the QDP.
We apply the theorem with m = 1, b = 2, 
?' = [ ], and ?' = [ ] on the rule
F(tt, s(zr0))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0] -> F(tt, s(s(s(zr0))))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0]
This rule is correct for the QDP as the following derivation shows:

F(tt, s(zr0))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0] -> F(tt, s(s(s(zr0))))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0]
    by Equivalence by Domain Renaming of the lhs with [zl0 / zr0]

        by Narrowing at position: [0]
        intermediate steps: Equiv IPS (rhs) - Equiv IPS (lhs) - Equiv IPS (rhs) - Equiv IPS (lhs) - Instantiation - Equiv DR (rhs) - Equiv DR (lhs) - Instantiation - Equiv DR (rhs) - Equiv DR (lhs)
        F(tt, s(zs1))[zs1 / s(zs1)]^n[zs1 / y0] -> F(isNat(y0), s(s(s(zs1))))[zs1 / s(zs1)]^n[zs1 / y0]
            by Narrowing at position: [0]
            intermediate steps: Instantiate mu - Instantiate Sigma - Instantiation - Instantiation
            F(tt, x)[ ]^n[ ] -> F(isNat(x), s(s(x)))[ ]^n[ ]
                by Rule from TRS P

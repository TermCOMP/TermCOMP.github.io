Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(a) -> f(b)
   g(b) -> g(a)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 0. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(a) -> f(b)
   g(b) -> g(a)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 7, 8

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 7 labelled f_1(0)* 3 to 8 labelled g_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 7 to 4 labelled b(0)* 8 to 4 labelled a(0)

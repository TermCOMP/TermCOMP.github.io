----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(y, f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, y), f(a, x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(y, f(x, y)) -> F(f(a, y), f(a, x))
   F(y, f(x, y)) -> F(a, y)
   F(y, f(x, y)) -> F(a, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(y, f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, y), f(a, x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(y, f(x, y)) -> F(a, y)
   F(y, f(x, y)) -> F(a, x)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] with arctic natural numbers [ARCTIC]:

   <<<
 POL(F(x_1, x_2)) =  	[[0A]] 	 +  	[[0A]] 	* 	x_1 	 +  	[[2A]] 	* 	x_2
>>>

   <<<
 POL(f(x_1, x_2)) =  	[[1A]] 	 +  	[[1A]] 	* 	x_1 	 +  	[[1A]] 	* 	x_2
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a) =  	[[0A]]
>>>


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   f(y, f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, y), f(a, x))


----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(y, f(x, y)) -> F(f(a, y), f(a, x))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(y, f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, y), f(a, x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPBoundsTAProof (EQUIVALENT)
The DP-Problem (P, R) could be shown to be Match-(raise-)DP-Bounded [TAB_NONLEFTLINEAR] by 1 for the Rule: 
   F(y, f(x, y)) -> F(f(a, y), f(a, x))
by considering the usable rules: 

   f(y, f(x, y)) -> f(f(a, y), f(a, x))

The compatible tree automaton used to show the Match-(raise-)DP-Boundedness is represented by:

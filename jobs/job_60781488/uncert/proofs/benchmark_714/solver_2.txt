Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 25 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, a) -> x
   f(x, g(y)) -> f(g(x), y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 2
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(g(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, a) -> x




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, g(y)) -> f(g(x), y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(g(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, g(y)) -> f(g(x), y)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

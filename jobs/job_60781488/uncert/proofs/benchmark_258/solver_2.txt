(8) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:

The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*MINUS(s(x), s(y)) -> MINUS(x, y)

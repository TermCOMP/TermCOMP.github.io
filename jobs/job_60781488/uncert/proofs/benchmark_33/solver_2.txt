----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, x) -> f(s(x), x, x)
   f(x, y, s(z)) -> s(f(0, 1, z))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, x) -> f(s(x), x, x)
   f(x, y, s(z)) -> s(f(0, 1, z))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, x0)
   f(x0, x1, s(x2))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(0, 1, x) -> F(s(x), x, x)
   F(x, y, s(z)) -> F(0, 1, z)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, x) -> f(s(x), x, x)
   f(x, y, s(z)) -> s(f(0, 1, z))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, x0)
   f(x0, x1, s(x2))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(0, 1, x) -> F(s(x), x, x)
   F(x, y, s(z)) -> F(0, 1, z)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, x0)
   f(x0, x1, s(x2))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(0, 1, x0)
   f(x0, x1, s(x2))


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(0, 1, x) -> F(s(x), x, x)
   F(x, y, s(z)) -> F(0, 1, z)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*F(x, y, s(z)) -> F(0, 1, z)
The graph contains the following edges 3 > 3


*F(0, 1, x) -> F(s(x), x, x)
The graph contains the following edges 3 >= 2, 3 >= 3


----------------------------------------

(10)
YES

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:

   fac(s(x)) -> *(fac(p(s(x))), s(x))
   p(s(0)) -> 0
   p(s(s(x))) -> s(p(s(x)))

   p(s(0))
   p(s(s(x0)))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.


Strictly oriented rules of the TRS R:

   p(s(0)) -> 0

Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 2
   POL(FAC(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(p(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2*x_1

(21) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   FAC(s(x)) -> FAC(p(s(x)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

POL( FAC_1(x_1) ) = x_1
POL( p_1(x_1) ) = max{0, x_1 - 2}
POL( s_1(x_1) ) = x_1 + 2

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

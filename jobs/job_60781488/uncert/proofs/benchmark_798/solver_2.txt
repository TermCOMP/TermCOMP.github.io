Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRS Reverse [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   half(0) -> 0
   half(s(0)) -> 0
   half(s(s(x))) -> s(half(x))
   bits(0) -> 0
   bits(s(x)) -> s(bits(half(s(x))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   0'(half(x)) -> 0'(x)
   0'(s(half(x))) -> 0'(x)
   s(s(half(x))) -> half(s(x))
   0'(bits(x)) -> 0'(x)
   s(bits(x)) -> s(half(bits(s(x))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   0'(half(x)) -> 0'(x)
   0'(s(half(x))) -> 0'(x)
   s(s(half(x))) -> half(s(x))
   0'(bits(x)) -> 0'(x)
   s(bits(x)) -> s(half(bits(s(x))))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 4 labelled 0'_1(0), 0'_1(1)* 3 to 5 labelled half_1(0)* 3 to 7 labelled s_1(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 4 labelled s_1(0)* 5 to 13 labelled half_1(1)* 5 to 14 labelled s_1(1)* 7 to 9 labelled half_1(0)* 9 to 10 labelled bits_1(0)* 10 to 4 labelled s_1(0)* 10 to 13 labelled half_1(1)* 10 to 14 labelled s_1(1)* 13 to 4 labelled s_1(1)* 13 to 13 labelled half_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled s_1(1)* 14 to 15 labelled half_1(1)* 15 to 16 labelled bits_1(1)* 16 to 4 labelled s_1(1)* 16 to 13 labelled half_1(1)* 16 to 14 labelled s_1(1)

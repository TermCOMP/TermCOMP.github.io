Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(a)) -> f(g(n__f(n__a)))
   f(X) -> n__f(X)
   a -> n__a
   activate(n__f(X)) -> f(activate(X))
   activate(n__a) -> a
   activate(X) -> X

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(a)) -> f(g(n__f(n__a)))
   f(X) -> n__f(X)
   a -> n__a
   activate(n__f(X)) -> f(activate(X))
   activate(n__a) -> a
   activate(X) -> X

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20

Node 1 is start node and node 3 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled f_1(0), n__f_1(1)* 1 to 3 labelled n__f_1(0), n__a(0), a(0), f_1(0), g_1(0), activate_1(0), n__a(1), n__f_1(1), a(1), f_1(1), g_1(1), activate_1(1), n__a(2), n__f_1(2)* 1 to 8 labelled f_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 1 to 1 labelled f_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 1 to 18 labelled f_1(2), n__f_1(3)* 3 to 3 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled g_1(0)* 5 to 3 labelled activate_1(0), a(1), f_1(1), g_1(1), n__f_1(1), n__a(1), activate_1(1), n__a(2), n__f_1(2)* 5 to 1 labelled f_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 5 to 8 labelled f_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 5 to 18 labelled f_1(2), n__f_1(3)* 6 to 7 labelled n__f_1(0)* 7 to 3 labelled n__a(0)* 8 to 9 labelled g_1(1)* 8 to 3 labelled activate_1(1), a(1), f_1(1), g_1(1), n__f_1(1), n__a(1), n__a(2), n__f_1(2)* 8 to 1 labelled f_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 8 to 8 labelled f_1(1), n__f_1(2)* 8 to 18 labelled f_1(2), n__f_1(3)* 9 to 10 labelled n__f_1(1)* 10 to 3 labelled n__a(1)* 18 to 19 labelled g_1(2)* 19 to 20 labelled n__f_1(2)* 20 to 3 labelled n__a(2)

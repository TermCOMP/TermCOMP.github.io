** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: *(_0,+(f(_1),f(_2))) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 0] *^#(_0,+(_3,f(_2))) -> *^#(g(_0,_2),+(_3,_3))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {_3->f(_1)} and theta2 = {_2->_1, _0->g(_0,_2)}.
We have r|p = *^#(g(_0,_2),+(_3,_3))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = *(_0,+(f(_1),f(_2)))
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1190

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(c) -> mark(f(g(c)))
   active(f(g(X))) -> mark(g(X))
   mark(c) -> active(c)
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(c) -> mark(f(g(c)))
   active(f(g(X))) -> mark(g(X))
   mark(c) -> active(c)
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(X))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 1 to 5 labelled mark_1(0), active_1(0), mark_1(1), active_1(1)* 1 to 7 labelled active_1(0)* 1 to 2 labelled f_1(0), g_1(0), f_1(1), g_1(1)* 1 to 11 labelled active_1(1)* 1 to 12 labelled mark_1(1)* 1 to 15 labelled active_1(2)* 1 to 20 labelled mark_1(2)* 1 to 22 labelled active_1(3)* 2 to 2 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled f_1(0)* 5 to 2 labelled g_1(0), g_1(1)* 6 to 7 labelled g_1(0)* 7 to 2 labelled c(0), f_1(0), f_1(1)* 11 to 6 labelled f_1(1)* 11 to 2 labelled g_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled f_1(1)* 12 to 7 labelled g_1(1)* 13 to 14 labelled g_1(1)* 14 to 2 labelled c(1)* 15 to 2 labelled g_1(2), g_1(1)* 15 to 13 labelled f_1(2)* 15 to 7 labelled g_1(2)* 20 to 14 labelled g_1(2)* 22 to 14 labelled g_1(3)

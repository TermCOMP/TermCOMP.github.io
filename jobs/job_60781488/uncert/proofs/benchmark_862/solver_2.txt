Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be disproven:

(0) QTRS
(1) NonTerminationProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(f(x))) -> h(f(g(f(x))))
   f(g(f(x))) -> f(f(x))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"h f f -> h f f"
h f f -> h f f
by OverlapClosure OC 2"h f f -> h f g f
by original rule (OC 1)""f g f -> f f
by original rule (OC 1)"

----------------------------------------

(2)
NO

Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y)
(RULES
f(x,y) -> x
g(a) -> h(a,b,a)
h(x,x,y) -> g(x)
i(x) -> f(x,x)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> x
 g(a) -> h(a,b,a)
 h(x,x,y) -> g(x)
 i(x) -> f(x,x)
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 H(x,x,y) -> G(x)
 I(x) -> F(x,x)
-> Rules:
 f(x,y) -> x
 g(a) -> h(a,b,a)
 h(x,x,y) -> g(x)
 i(x) -> f(x,x)

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 H(x,x,y) -> G(x)

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, y) -> x
   g(a) -> h(a, b, a)
   i(x) -> f(x, x)
   h(x, x, y) -> g(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 0
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(g(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(h(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2 + x_3
   POL(i(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, y) -> x




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(a) -> h(a, b, a)
   i(x) -> f(x, x)
   h(x, x, y) -> g(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a) = 0
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(g(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(h(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2 + x_3
   POL(i(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   i(x) -> f(x, x)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(a) -> h(a, b, a)
   h(x, x, y) -> g(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Quasi precedence:
a > [g_1, h_3, b]


Status:
g_1: [1]
a: multiset status
h_3: [2,1,3]
b: multiset status

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   g(a) -> h(a, b, a)
   h(x, x, y) -> g(x)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

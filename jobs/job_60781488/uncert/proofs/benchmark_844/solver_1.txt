** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: fib1(_0,_1) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 0] fib1^#(_0,_1) -> fib1^#(_1,add(_0,_1))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {_2->_1} and theta2 = {_2->add(_0,_2), _0->_2}.
We have r|p = fib1^#(_1,add(_0,_1))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = fib1(_0,_1)
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 3

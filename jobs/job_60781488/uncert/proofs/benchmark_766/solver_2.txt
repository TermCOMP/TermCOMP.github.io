Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 22 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, x) -> a
   f(g(x), y) -> f(x, y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:g_1 > f_2 > a

and weight map:

   a=2
   g_1=0
   f_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(x, x) -> a
   f(g(x), y) -> f(x, y)




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(4)
YES

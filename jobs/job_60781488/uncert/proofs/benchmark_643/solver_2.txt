Finiteness of the DP problem can be shown by a matchbound of 1. 
As the DP problem is minimal we only have to initialize the certificate graph by the rules of P:

   e1(e(c(x0))) -> d1(e(d(x0)))
   d1(d(e(x0))) -> c1(d(c(x0)))

To find matches we regarded all rules of R and P:

   c(c(x)) -> e(d(x))
   e(e(x)) -> d(c(x))
   d(d(x)) -> c(e(x))
   c1(c(d(x0))) -> e1(c(e(x0)))
   e1(e(c(x0))) -> d1(e(d(x0)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(F(x_1)) =  	[[0]] 	 +  	[[2, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(g(x_1, x_2)) =  	[[1], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 1], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1 	 +  	[[0, 0], [1, 1]] 	* 	x_2
>>>

   <<<
 POL(f(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[0, 1], [3, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(a) =  	[[0], [0]]
>>>

   <<<
 POL(e) =  	[[0], [0]]
>>>

   <<<
 POL(d) =  	[[0], [0]]
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c) =  	[[0], [0]]

   <<<
 POL(b) =  	[[0], [0]]

The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   f(g(x, y)) -> g(y, g(f(f(x)), a))
   g(e, g(e, x)) -> g(d, g(c, x))
   g(d, g(d, x)) -> g(c, g(e, x))
   g(c, g(c, x)) -> g(e, g(d, x))
   g(x, g(y, g(x, y))) -> g(a, g(x, g(y, b)))

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(c, g(c, x)) -> g(e, g(d, x))
   g(d, g(d, x)) -> g(c, g(e, x))
   g(e, g(e, x)) -> g(d, g(c, x))
   f(g(x, y)) -> g(y, g(f(f(x)), a))
   g(x, g(y, g(x, y))) -> g(a, g(x, g(y, b)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

(61) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.

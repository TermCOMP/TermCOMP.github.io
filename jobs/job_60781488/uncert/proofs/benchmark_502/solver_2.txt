(21) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   GCD(x, s(y), s(z)) -> GCD(x, -(max(y, z), min(y, z)), s(min(y, z)))
   GCD(s(x), s(y), z) -> GCD(-(max(x, y), min(x, y)), s(min(x, y)), z)
   GCD(s(x), y, s(z)) -> GCD(-(max(x, z), min(x, z)), y, s(min(x, z)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO,RATPOLO]:

   POL(-(x_1, x_2)) = x_1
   POL(0) = 0
   POL(GCD(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = x_1 + x_2 + [1/2]x_3
   POL(max(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(min(x_1, x_2)) = [1/2]x_1 + [1/2]x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = [4] + [4]x_1
The value of delta used in the strict ordering is 4.
The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   max(x, 0) -> x
   max(0, y) -> y
   max(s(x), s(y)) -> s(max(x, y))
   min(x, 0) -> 0
   min(0, y) -> 0
   min(s(x), s(y)) -> s(min(x, y))
   -(x, 0) -> x
   -(s(x), s(y)) -> -(x, y)

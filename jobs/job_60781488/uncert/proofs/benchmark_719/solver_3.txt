Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty x y)
(RULES
f(g(x),y,y) -> g(f(x,x,y))
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 f(g(x),y,y) -> g(f(x,x,y))
-> The term rewriting system is non-overlaping or locally confluent overlay system. Therefore, innermost termination implies termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(g(x),y,y) -> F(x,x,y)
-> Rules:
 f(g(x),y,y) -> g(f(x,x,y))

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:

Problem 1: 

Subterm Processor:
-> Pairs:
 F(g(x),y,y) -> F(x,x,y)
-> Rules:
 f(g(x),y,y) -> g(f(x,x,y))
->Projection:

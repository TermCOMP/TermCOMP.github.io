Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(L(x)) -> L(a(x))
   R(a(x)) -> a(R(x))
   a(L(L(x))) -> a(L(R(x)))
   R(R(a(x))) -> L(a(R(a(x))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) NonTerminationProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [OPPELT08] to show that the SRS problem is infinite.

Found the self-embedding DerivationStructure: 
"a L R (a)^k R a -> a L R (a)^k+1 R a"

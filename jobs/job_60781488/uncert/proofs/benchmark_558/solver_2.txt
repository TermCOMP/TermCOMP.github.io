(19) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   DIV(s(X), s(Y)) -> DIV(minus(X, Y), s(Y))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
DIV(x1, x2)  =  x1

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

minus(x1, x2)  =  x1

p(x1)  =  x1


Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:trivial

* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: f(n__a,n__b,n__b) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 5] f^#(n__a,n__b,n__b) -> f^#(n__a,n__b,n__b)
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {} and theta2 = {}.
We have r|p = f^#(n__a,n__b,n__b)
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = f(n__a,n__b,n__b)
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 53

----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(a, a), x) -> f(f(x, a), f(a, f(a, a)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(a, a), x) -> f(f(x, a), f(a, f(a, a)))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(f(a, a), x0)


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(f(a, a), x) -> F(f(x, a), f(a, f(a, a)))
   F(f(a, a), x) -> F(x, a)
   F(f(a, a), x) -> F(a, f(a, a))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(a, a), x) -> f(f(x, a), f(a, f(a, a)))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(f(a, a), x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.

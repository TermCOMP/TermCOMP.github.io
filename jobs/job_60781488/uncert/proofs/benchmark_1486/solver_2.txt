----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(f, a(f, x)) -> a(x, x)
   a(h, x) -> a(f, a(g, a(f, x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(f, a(f, x)) -> A(x, x)
   A(h, x) -> A(f, a(g, a(f, x)))
   A(h, x) -> A(g, a(f, x))
   A(h, x) -> A(f, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(f, a(f, x)) -> a(x, x)
   a(h, x) -> a(f, a(g, a(f, x)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   A(h, x) -> A(f, x)
   A(f, a(f, x)) -> A(x, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(f, a(f, x)) -> a(x, x)
   a(h, x) -> a(f, a(g, a(f, x)))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*A(f, a(f, x)) -> A(x, x)
The graph contains the following edges 2 > 1, 2 > 2


*A(h, x) -> A(f, x)
The graph contains the following edges 2 >= 2


----------------------------------------

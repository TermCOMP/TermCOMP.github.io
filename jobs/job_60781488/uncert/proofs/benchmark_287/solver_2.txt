We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is 
   f(s(x), y) -> f(x, y)
   f(x, s(y)) -> f(x, y)
   f(0, 0) -> tt

As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*F(x, s(y)) -> F(x, y)
The graph contains the following edges 1 >= 1, 2 > 2


*F(s(x), y) -> F(x, y)

----------------------------------------

(17) NonLoopProof (COMPLETE)
By Theorem 8 [NONLOOP] we deduce infiniteness of the QDP.
We apply the theorem with m = 1, b = 1, 
?' = [ ], and ?' = [ ] on the rule
G(tt, s(zr0), s(zr2))[zr0 / s(zr0), zr2 / s(zr2)]^n[zr0 / 0, zr2 / 0] -> G(tt, s(s(zr0)), s(s(zr2)))[zr0 / s(zr0), zr2 / s(zr2)]^n[zr0 / 0, zr2 / 0]
This rule is correct for the QDP as the following derivation shows:

G(tt, s(zr0), s(zr2))[zr0 / s(zr0), zr2 / s(zr2)]^n[zr0 / 0, zr2 / 0] -> G(tt, s(s(zr0)), s(s(zr2)))[zr0 / s(zr0), zr2 / s(zr2)]^n[zr0 / 0, zr2 / 0]

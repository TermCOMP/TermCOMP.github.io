* Certificate: f(tt,Cons(tt,nil)) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following pattern rule was generated by the strategy
presented in Sect. 3 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]:
[iteration = 2] f(tt,Cons(tt,_0)){_0->Cons(tt,_0)}^n{_0->nil} -> f(tt,Cons(tt,Cons(tt,_0))){_0->Cons(tt,_0)}^n{_0->nil}
We apply Theorem 8 of [Emmes, Enger, Giesl, IJCAR'12]
on this rule with m = 1, b = 1, pi = epsilon,
sigma' = {} and mu' = {}.
Hence the term f(tt,Cons(tt,nil)), obtained from
instantiating n with 0 in the left-hand side of
the rule, starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t.
the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 282

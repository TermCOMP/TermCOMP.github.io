Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) AAECC Innermost [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) DependencyPairsProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) QDP
(5) DependencyGraphProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) TRUE


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, x) -> f(x, x, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   f(0, 1, x) -> f(x, x, x)

The signature Sigma is {f_3}
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, x) -> f(x, x, x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, x0)


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(0, 1, x) -> F(x, x, x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0, 1, x) -> f(x, x, x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(0, 1, x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(6)
TRUE

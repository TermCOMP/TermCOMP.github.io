Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 31 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   app(app(plus, 0), y) -> y
   app(app(plus, app(s, x)), y) -> app(s, app(app(plus, x), y))
   app(app(app(curry, f), x), y) -> app(app(f, x), y)
   add -> app(curry, plus)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 1
   POL(add) = 2
   POL(app(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(curry) = 0
   POL(plus) = 0
   POL(s) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   app(app(plus, 0), y) -> y
   app(app(plus, app(s, x)), y) -> app(s, app(app(plus, x), y))
   app(app(app(curry, f), x), y) -> app(app(f, x), y)




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   add -> app(curry, plus)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:plus > curry > add > app_2

and weight map:

   add=2
   curry=1
   plus=1
   app_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   add -> app(curry, plus)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

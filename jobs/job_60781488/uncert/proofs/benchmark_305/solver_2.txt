(19) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   COND(true, x, y) -> COND(gr(x, y), p(x), y)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO,RATPOLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(COND(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = [1/4]x_1 + [4]x_2
   POL(false) = 0
   POL(gr(x_1, x_2)) = [2]x_1
   POL(p(x_1)) = [1/4]x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = [4] + [4]x_1
   POL(true) = [1/4]
The value of delta used in the strict ordering is 1/16.
The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   gr(0, x) -> false
   gr(s(x), 0) -> true
   gr(s(x), s(y)) -> gr(x, y)

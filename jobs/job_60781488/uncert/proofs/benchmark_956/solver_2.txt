Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(c(f(g(f(a)))))
   active(f(X)) -> f(active(X))
   active(g(X)) -> g(active(X))
   f(mark(X)) -> mark(f(X))

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a'(f(f(active(x)))) -> a'(f(g(f(c(mark(x))))))
   f(active(X)) -> active(f(X))
   g(active(X)) -> active(g(X))

Q is empty.

(3) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 6. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a'(f(f(active(x)))) -> a'(f(g(f(c(mark(x))))))
   f(active(X)) -> active(f(X))
   g(active(X)) -> active(g(X))
   mark(f(X)) -> f(mark(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> g(mark(X))
   f(proper(X)) -> proper(f(X))
   a'(proper(x)) -> a'(ok(x))
   c(proper(X)) -> proper(c(X))
   g(proper(X)) -> proper(g(X))
   ok(f(X)) -> f(ok(X))
   ok(c(X)) -> c(ok(X))
   ok(g(X)) -> g(ok(X))
   mark(top(X)) -> proper(top(X))
   ok(top(X)) -> active(top(X))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 42, 43, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 80, 81, 91

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 31 ms]
(2) QTRS
(3) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) QTRS
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(X), X) -> f(X, a(X))
   f(X, c(X)) -> f(s(X), X)
   f(X, X) -> c(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = 2 + 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(X, c(X)) -> f(s(X), X)
   f(X, X) -> c(X)




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(X), X) -> f(X, a(X))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Knuth-Bendix order [KBO] with precedence:f_2 > a_1 > s_1

and weight map:

   s_1=1
   a_1=1
   f_2=0

The variable weight is 1With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(s(X), X) -> f(X, a(X))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

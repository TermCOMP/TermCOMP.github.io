Termination of the given GTRS could be disproven:

(0) GTRS
(1) CritRuleProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Generalized rewrite system (where rules with free variables on rhs are allowed):
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   tail(cons(X)) -> XS
   zeros -> cons(0)


----------------------------------------

(1) CritRuleProof (COMPLETE)
The rule tail(cons(X)) -> XS contains free variables in its right-hand side. Hence the TRS is not-terminating.
----------------------------------------

(2)
NO

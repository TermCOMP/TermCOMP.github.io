(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, c(y)) -> f(x, s(f(y, y)))
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> f(x, s(c(s(y))))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) Overlay + Local Confluence (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS is overlay and locally confluent. By [NOC] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, c(y)) -> f(x, s(f(y, y)))
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> f(x, s(c(s(y))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, c(x1))
   f(s(x0), s(x1))


----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(x, c(y)) -> F(x, s(f(y, y)))
   F(x, c(y)) -> F(y, y)
   F(s(x), s(y)) -> F(x, s(c(s(y))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(x, c(y)) -> f(x, s(f(y, y)))
   f(s(x), s(y)) -> f(x, s(c(s(y))))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(x0, c(x1))
   f(s(x0), s(x1))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

   f(x0, c(x1))
   f(s(x0), s(x1))

----------------------------------------

(8) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

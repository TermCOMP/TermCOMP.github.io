Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS
(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) YES

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(x)) -> f(x)
   g(0) -> g(f(0))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(x)) -> f(x)
   g(0) -> g(f(0))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
2, 6, 7, 8

Node 2 is start node and node 6 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 2 to 6 labelled f_1(0), f_1(1)* 2 to 7 labelled g_1(0)* 6 to 6 labelled #_1(0)* 7 to 8 labelled f_1(0)* 8 to 6 labelled 0(0)

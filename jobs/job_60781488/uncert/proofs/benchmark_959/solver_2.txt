Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(c(f(g(f(a)))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(c(X)) -> active(c(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   c(mark(X)) -> c(X)
   c(active(X)) -> c(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

Q is empty.

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 3. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   active(f(f(a))) -> mark(c(f(g(f(a)))))
   mark(f(X)) -> active(f(mark(X)))
   mark(a) -> active(a)
   mark(c(X)) -> active(c(X))
   mark(g(X)) -> active(g(mark(X)))
   f(mark(X)) -> f(X)
   f(active(X)) -> f(X)
   c(mark(X)) -> c(X)
   c(active(X)) -> c(X)
   g(mark(X)) -> g(X)
   g(active(X)) -> g(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
1, 2, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62

Node 1 is start node and node 2 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

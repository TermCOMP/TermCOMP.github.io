(4) QTRS
(5) QTRSRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]

(9) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(10) YES

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   double(0) -> 0
   double(s(x)) -> s(s(double(x)))
   +(x, 0) -> x
   +(x, s(y)) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))
   double(x) -> +(x, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(+(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(0) = 1
   POL(double(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   double(0) -> 0
   +(x, 0) -> x




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   double(s(x)) -> s(s(double(x)))
   +(x, s(y)) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))
   double(x) -> +(x, x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(+(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(double(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   double(x) -> +(x, x)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   double(s(x)) -> s(s(double(x)))
   +(x, s(y)) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(+(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(double(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   +(x, s(y)) -> s(+(x, y))
   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   double(s(x)) -> s(s(double(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Quasi precedence:
double_1 > s_1


Status:
double_1: [1]
s_1: [1]

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   double(s(x)) -> s(s(double(x)))




----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(9) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

(10)
YES

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(f(X)) -> f(a(b(f(X))))
   f(a(g(X))) -> b(X)
   b(X) -> a(X)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   f(f(X)) -> f(a(b(f(X))))
   f(a(g(X))) -> b(X)
   b(X) -> a(X)

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 5 labelled f_1(0)* 3 to 4 labelled b_1(0), a_1(0), a_1(1)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 5 to 6 labelled a_1(0)* 6 to 7 labelled b_1(0), a_1(1)* 7 to 4 labelled f_1(0), b_1(1), a_1(2)* 7 to 11 labelled f_1(1)* 11 to 12 labelled a_1(1)* 12 to 13 labelled b_1(1), a_1(2)* 13 to 4 labelled f_1(1), b_1(1), a_1(2)* 13 to 11 labelled f_1(1)

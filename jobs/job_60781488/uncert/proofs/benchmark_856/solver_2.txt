----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(h(x)) -> f(i(x))
   f(i(x)) -> a
   i(x) -> h(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRS Reverse (EQUIVALENT)
We applied the QTRS Reverse Processor [REVERSE].
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x)) -> i(f(x))
   i(f(x)) -> a'(x)
   i(x) -> h(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a'(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(f(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(h(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(i(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   i(f(x)) -> a'(x)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x)) -> i(f(x))
   i(x) -> h(x)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   h(f(x)) -> i(f(x))
   i(x) -> h(x)

The signature Sigma is {h_1, i_1}
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x)) -> i(f(x))
   i(x) -> h(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0))
   i(x0)


----------------------------------------

(7) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(x)) -> I(f(x))
   I(x) -> H(x)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   h(f(x)) -> i(f(x))
   i(x) -> h(x)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0))
   i(x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
As all Q-normal forms are R-normal forms we are in the innermost case. Hence, by the usable rules processor [LPAR04] we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.
----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(x)) -> I(f(x))
   I(x) -> H(x)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   h(f(x0))
   i(x0)

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   h(f(x0))
   i(x0)


----------------------------------------

(12)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   H(f(x)) -> I(f(x))
   I(x) -> H(x)

R is empty.
Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(13) NonTerminationLoopProof (COMPLETE)
We used the non-termination processor [FROCOS05] to show that the DP problem is infinite.
Found a loop by narrowing to the left:

s = I(f(x)) evaluates to  t =I(f(x))

Thus s starts an infinite chain as s semiunifies with t with the following substitutions:
* Matcher: [ ]
* Semiunifier: [ ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewriting sequence

I(f(x)) -> H(f(x))
with rule I(x') -> H(x') at position [] and matcher [x' / f(x)]

H(f(x)) -> I(f(x))
with rule H(f(x)) -> I(f(x))

Now applying the matcher to the start term leads to a term which is equal to the last term in the rewriting sequence


All these steps are and every following step will be a correct step w.r.t to Q.

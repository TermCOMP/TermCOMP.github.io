Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(b(a(X))) -> a(a(b(b(c(c(X))))))
   a(X) -> e
   b(X) -> e
   c(X) -> e

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 2. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   c(b(a(X))) -> a(a(b(b(c(c(X))))))
   a(X) -> e
   b(X) -> e
   c(X) -> e

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24

Node 3 is start node and node 4 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 3 to 10 labelled a_1(0), e(1)* 3 to 4 labelled e(0)* 4 to 4 labelled #_1(0)* 10 to 11 labelled a_1(0), e(1)* 11 to 12 labelled b_1(0), e(1)* 12 to 13 labelled b_1(0), e(1)* 13 to 14 labelled c_1(0), e(1)* 14 to 4 labelled c_1(0), e(1)* 14 to 20 labelled a_1(1), e(2)* 20 to 21 labelled a_1(1), e(2)* 21 to 22 labelled b_1(1), e(2)* 22 to 23 labelled b_1(1), e(2)* 23 to 24 labelled c_1(1), e(2)* 24 to 4 labelled c_1(1), e(2)* 24 to 20 labelled a_1(1), e(2)

Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> b(c(c(c(c(y)))), x)
   c(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> a(0, c(c(a(y, 0))))
   c(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> c(y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(c(c(y))))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(c(y)))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(y))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(y)
   C(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> C(c(a(y, 0)))
   C(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> C(a(y, 0))
   C(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> C(y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> b(c(c(c(c(y)))), x)
   c(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> a(0, c(c(a(y, 0))))
   c(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> c(y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(c(y)))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(c(c(y))))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(y))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(y)
   C(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> C(c(a(y, 0)))
   C(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> C(y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> b(c(c(c(c(y)))), x)
   c(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> a(0, c(c(a(y, 0))))
   c(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> c(y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(5) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(c(y)))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(c(c(y))))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(c(y))
   C(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> C(y)
   C(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> C(c(a(y, 0)))
   C(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> C(y)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO,RATPOLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(C(x_1)) = [2]x_1
   POL(a(x_1, x_2)) = [1/2] + [1/2]x_1 + [4]x_2
   POL(b(x_1, x_2)) = [4] + [1/2]x_1
   POL(c(x_1)) = [4]x_1
The value of delta used in the strict ordering is 6.
The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   c(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> b(c(c(c(c(y)))), x)
   c(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> a(0, c(c(a(y, 0))))
   c(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> c(y)

Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   c(c(c(a(x, y)))) -> b(c(c(c(c(y)))), x)
   c(c(b(c(y), 0))) -> a(0, c(c(a(y, 0))))
   c(c(a(a(y, 0), x))) -> c(y)

Q is empty.
We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

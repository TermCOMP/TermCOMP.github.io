----------------------------------------

(1) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(6) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

   round(0) -> 0
   round(0) -> s(0)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(13) NonMonReductionPairProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using the following max-polynomial ordering, we can orient the general usable rules and all rules from P weakly and some rules from P strictly:

Polynomial interpretation with max [POLO,NEGPOLO,MAXPOLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(F(x_1, x_2)) = max(0, x_1 - x_2)
   POL(round(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 1 + x_1


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F(s(x), x) -> F(s(x), round(s(x)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
none
The following rules are usable:
   s(0) -> round(s(0))

   0 -> round(0)
   s(0) -> round(0)

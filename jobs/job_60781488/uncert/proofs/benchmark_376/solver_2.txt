(24) NonLoopProof (COMPLETE)
By Theorem 8 [NONLOOP] we deduce infiniteness of the QDP.
We apply the theorem with m = 2, b = 1, 
?' = [ ], and ?' = [ ] on the rule
F(true, s(zr0))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0] -> F(true, s(s(zr0)))[zr0 / s(s(zr0))]^n[zr0 / 0]
This rule is correct for the QDP as the following derivation shows:

F(true, s(zr0))[zr0 / s(zr0)]^n[zr0 / 0] -> F(true, s(s(zr0)))[zr0 / s(s(zr0))]^n[zr0 / 0]

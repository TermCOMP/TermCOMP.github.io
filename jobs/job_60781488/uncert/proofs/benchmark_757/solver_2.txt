Termination w.r.t. Q of the given QTRS could be proven:

(0) QTRS

(2) YES

Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   a(a(x)) -> a(b(a(x)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) RFCMatchBoundsTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Termination of the TRS R could be shown with a Match Bound [MATCHBOUNDS1,MATCHBOUNDS2] of 1. This implies Q-termination of R.
The following rules were used to construct the certificate:

   a(a(x)) -> a(b(a(x)))

The certificate found is represented by the following graph.
The certificate consists of the following enumerated nodes:
43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48

Node 43 is start node and node 44 is final node.

Those nodes are connected through the following edges:

* 43 to 45 labelled a_1(0)* 44 to 44 labelled #_1(0)* 45 to 46 labelled b_1(0)* 46 to 44 labelled a_1(0)* 46 to 47 labelled a_1(1)* 47 to 48 labelled b_1(1)* 48 to 44 labelled a_1(1)* 48 to 47 labelled a_1(1)

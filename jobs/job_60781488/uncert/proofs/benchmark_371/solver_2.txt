(24) NonLoopProof (COMPLETE)
By Theorem 8 [NONLOOP] we deduce infiniteness of the QDP.
We apply the theorem with m = 1, b = 1, 
?' = [zr3 / s(zr3)], and ?' = [zr3 / double(s(zr3))] on the rule
F(true, s(s(s(zr3))), s(zr2))[zr3 / s(zr3), zr2 / s(zr2)]^n[zr2 / 0] -> F(true, s(s(s(s(zr3)))), s(s(zr2)))[zr2 / s(zr2), zr3 / s(s(zr3))]^n[zr2 / 0, zr3 / double(s(zr3))]
This rule is correct for the QDP as the following derivation shows:

F(true, s(s(s(zr3))), s(zr2))[zr3 / s(zr3), zr2 / s(zr2)]^n[zr2 / 0] -> F(true, s(s(s(s(zr3)))), s(s(zr2)))[zr2 / s(zr2), zr3 / s(s(zr3))]^n[zr2 / 0, zr3 / double(s(zr3))]

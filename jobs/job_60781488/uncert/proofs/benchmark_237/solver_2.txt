We simplified constraint (1) using rules (I), (II), (III) which results in the following new constraint:

(2)    (le(x53, x54)=false  ==>  IF3(false, x52, x53, x54)_>=_GEN(s(x52), x54))

*(GEN(s(x74), x76)_>=_IF1(le(s(x74), x76), s(x74), x76))








The constraints for P_> respective P_bound are constructed from P__>=_ where we just replace every occurence of "t _>=_ s" in P__>=_ by  "t > s" respective "t _>=_ c". Here c stands for the fresh constant used for P_bound. 

Using the following integer polynomial ordering the  resulting constraints can be solved 

Polynomial interpretation [NONINF]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(GEN(x_1, x_2)) = -1 - x_1 + x_2
   POL(IF1(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = -1 - x_1 - x_2 + x_3
   POL(IF2(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = -1 - x_1 + x_3
   POL(IF3(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) = -1 - x_1 - x_2 + x_4
   POL(c) = -2
   POL(false) = 0
   POL(le(x_1, x_2)) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(true) = 0


The following pairs  are in P_>:
   IF3(false, x, y, x_removed) -> GEN(s(x), x_removed)
The following pairs are in P_bound:

For Pair IF3(true, x, y, x_removed) -> IF2(x, s(y), x_removed) the following chains were created:
*We consider the chain IF2(x36, x37, x38) -> IF3(le(x37, x38), x36, x37, x38), IF3(true, x39, x40, x41) -> IF2(x39, s(x40), x41) which results in the following constraint:

(1)    (IF3(le(x37, x38), x36, x37, x38)=IF3(true, x39, x40, x41)  ==>  IF3(true, x39, x40, x41)_>=_IF2(x39, s(x40), x41))



We simplified constraint (1) using rules (I), (II), (III) which results in the following new constraint:

(2)    (le(x37, x38)=true  ==>  IF3(true, x36, x37, x38)_>=_IF2(x36, s(x37), x38))



We simplified constraint (2) using rule (V) (with possible (I) afterwards) using induction on le(x37, x38)=true which results in the following new constraints:

(3)    (true=true  ==>  IF3(true, x36, 0, x85)_>=_IF2(x36, s(0), x85))

(4)    (le(x87, x86)=true & (\/x88:le(x87, x86)=true  ==>  IF3(true, x88, x87, x86)_>=_IF2(x88, s(x87), x86))  ==>  IF3(true, x36, s(x87), s(x86))_>=_IF2(x36, s(s(x87)), s(x86)))



We simplified constraint (3) using rules (I), (II) which results in the following new constraint:

(5)    (IF3(true, x36, 0, x85)_>=_IF2(x36, s(0), x85))



We simplified constraint (4) using rule (VI) where we applied the induction hypothesis (\/x88:le(x87, x86)=true  ==>  IF3(true, x88, x87, x86)_>=_IF2(x88, s(x87), x86)) with sigma = [x88 / x36] which results in the following new constraint:

(6)    (IF3(true, x36, x87, x86)_>=_IF2(x36, s(x87), x86)  ==>  IF3(true, x36, s(x87), s(x86))_>=_IF2(x36, s(s(x87)), s(x86)))








To summarize, we get the following constraints P__>=_ for the following pairs.

*IF2(x, y, x_removed) -> IF3(le(y, x_removed), x, y, x_removed)

*(IF2(x23, s(x24), x25)_>=_IF3(le(s(x24), x25), x23, s(x24), x25))




*IF3(true, x, y, x_removed) -> IF2(x, s(y), x_removed)

*(IF3(true, x36, 0, x85)_>=_IF2(x36, s(0), x85))


*(IF3(true, x36, x87, x86)_>=_IF2(x36, s(x87), x86)  ==>  IF3(true, x36, s(x87), s(x86))_>=_IF2(x36, s(s(x87)), s(x86)))








The constraints for P_> respective P_bound are constructed from P__>=_ where we just replace every occurence of "t _>=_ s" in P__>=_ by  "t > s" respective "t _>=_ c". Here c stands for the fresh constant used for P_bound. 

Using the following integer polynomial ordering the  resulting constraints can be solved 

Polynomial interpretation [NONINF]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(IF2(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = -1 + x_1 - x_2 + x_3
   POL(IF3(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) = -1 - x_1 + x_2 - x_3 + x_4
   POL(c) = -2
   POL(false) = 0
   POL(le(x_1, x_2)) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(true) = 0

** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: app(app(app(subst,_0),app(fix,app(subst,_1))),_2) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 1] app^#(app(app(subst,_0),app(fix,_3)),_2) -> app^#(app(_3,app(fix,_3)),_2)
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {_3->app(subst,_1)} and theta2 = {_0->_1, _2->_2}.
We have r|p = app^#(app(_3,app(fix,_3)),_2)
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = app(app(app(subst,_0),app(fix,app(subst,_1))),_2)
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 60

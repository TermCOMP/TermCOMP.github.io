(0)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> cons(0, n__f(s(0)))
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))
   p(s(0)) -> 0
   f(X) -> n__f(X)
   activate(n__f(X)) -> f(X)
   activate(X) -> X

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(1) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 1
   POL(activate(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(f(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(n__f(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(p(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   p(s(0)) -> 0
   f(X) -> n__f(X)
   activate(n__f(X)) -> f(X)
   activate(X) -> X




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> cons(0, n__f(s(0)))
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) QTRSRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + x_2
   POL(f(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(n__f(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(p(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(0) -> cons(0, n__f(s(0)))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) AAECC Innermost (EQUIVALENT)
We have applied [NOC,AAECCNOC] to switch to innermost. The TRS R 1 is none

The TRS R 2 is 
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))

The signature Sigma is {f_1}
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(s(0))


----------------------------------------

(7) DependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.
----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(0)) -> F(p(s(0)))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(s(0))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 0 SCCs with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

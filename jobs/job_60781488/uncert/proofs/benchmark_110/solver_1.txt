** BEGIN proof argument **
* Technique: [Payet, LOPSTR'18]
* Certificate: ap(f,_0) is non-terminating
* Description:
The following rule R was generated while unfolding
the dependency pairs of the analyzed TRS:
[iteration = 0] ap^#(f,_0) -> ap^#(f,app(g,_0))
Let l be the left-hand side and r be the right-hand side of R.
Let p = epsilon, theta1 = {} and theta2 = {_0->app(g,_0)}.
We have r|p = ap^#(f,app(g,_0))
and theta2(theta1(l)) = theta1(r|p), i.e., l semi-unifies with r|p.
So, the term theta1(l) = ap(f,_0)
starts an infinite rewrite sequence w.r.t. the analyzed TRS.
** END proof argument **
Total number of generated unfolded rules = 1

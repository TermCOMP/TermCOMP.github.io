Q restricted rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   p(a(x0), p(b(a(x1)), x2)) -> p(x1, p(a(b(a(x1))), x2))
   a(b(a(x0))) -> b(a(b(x0)))

Using Dependency Pairs [AG00,LPAR04] we result in the following initial DP problem.

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   P(a(x0), p(b(a(x1)), x2)) -> P(x1, p(a(b(a(x1))), x2))
   P(a(x0), p(b(a(x1)), x2)) -> P(a(b(a(x1))), x2)

   a(b(a(x0))) -> b(a(b(x0)))

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(3) DependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)

   p(a(x0), p(b(a(x1)), x2)) -> p(x1, p(a(b(a(x1))), x2))
   a(b(a(x0))) -> b(a(b(x0)))

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(6) UsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)
We can use the usable rules and reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with the Ce-compatible extension of the polynomial order that maps every function symbol to the sum of its arguments. Then, we can delete all non-usable rules [FROCOS05] from R.

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(8) UsableRulesReductionPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the usable rules with reduction pair processor [LPAR04] with a polynomial ordering [POLO], all dependency pairs and the corresponding usable rules [FROCOS05] can be oriented non-strictly. All non-usable rules are removed, and those dependency pairs and usable rules that have been oriented strictly or contain non-usable symbols in their left-hand side are removed as well.

The following dependency pairs can be deleted:

   A(b(a(x0))) -> A(b(x0))
No rules are removed from R.

Used ordering: POLO with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(A(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(a(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(b(x_1)) = 2*x_1

(15) TransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By forward instantiating [JAR06] the rule P(a(x0), p(b(a(x1)), x2)) -> P(x1, p(a(b(a(x1))), x2)) we obtained the following new rules [LPAR04]:

   (P(a(x0), p(b(a(a(y_0))), x2)) -> P(a(y_0), p(a(b(a(a(y_0)))), x2)),P(a(x0), p(b(a(a(y_0))), x2)) -> P(a(y_0), p(a(b(a(a(y_0)))), x2)))

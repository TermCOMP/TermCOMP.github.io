Termination of the given RelTRS could be proven:

(0) RelTRS
(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) RelADPP
(3) RelADPDepGraphProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) TRUE


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   f(x) -> x

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   a -> g(a)


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   f(x) -> x

and relative ADPs:

   a -> g(A)


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  0 SCCs with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 0 subproblems.

----------------------------------------

(4)
TRUE

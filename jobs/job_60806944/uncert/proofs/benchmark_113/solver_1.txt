Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   f(s(x), y) -> f(-(s(x), y), y)

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   +(s(x), y) -> s(+(x, y))
   -(0, y) -> 0
   -(s(x), s(y)) -> -(x, y)
   -(x, 0) -> x
   f(x, y) -> f(x, +(x, y))
   +(0, y) -> y


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRSLoopFinderProof (COMPLETE)
The following loop was found:

---------- Loop: ----------

f(-(s(x), 0), 0) -> f(s(x), 0) with rule -(x', 0) -> x' at position [0] and matcher [x' / s(x)]

f(s(x), 0) -> f(-(s(x), 0), 0) with rule f(s(x'), y) -> f(-(s(x'), y), y) at position [] and matcher [x' / x, y / 0]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

Therefore, the relative TRS problem does not terminate.

Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   le(0, y) -> true
   le(s(x), 0) -> false
   le(s(x), s(y)) -> le(x, y)
   pred(s(x)) -> x
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(minus(x, y))
   gcd(0, y) -> y
   gcd(s(x), 0) -> s(x)
   gcd(s(x), s(y)) -> if_gcd(le(y, x), s(x), s(y))
   if_gcd(true, s(x), s(y)) -> gcd(minus(x, y), s(y))
   if_gcd(false, s(x), s(y)) -> gcd(minus(y, x), s(x))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   rand(x) -> rand(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   le(0, y) -> true
   le(s(x), 0) -> false
   le(s(x), s(y)) -> LE(x, y)
   pred(s(x)) -> x
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(x, s(y)) -> PRED(minus(x, y))
   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(MINUS(x, y))
   gcd(0, y) -> y
   gcd(s(x), 0) -> s(x)
   gcd(s(x), s(y)) -> IF_GCD(le(y, x), s(x), s(y))
   gcd(s(x), s(y)) -> if_gcd(LE(y, x), s(x), s(y))
   if_gcd(true, s(x), s(y)) -> GCD(minus(x, y), s(y))
   if_gcd(true, s(x), s(y)) -> gcd(MINUS(x, y), s(y))
   if_gcd(false, s(x), s(y)) -> GCD(minus(y, x), s(x))
   if_gcd(false, s(x), s(y)) -> gcd(MINUS(y, x), s(x))

and relative ADPs:

   rand(x) -> RAND(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  3 SCCs with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 3 subproblems.

----------------------------------------

Complex Obligation (AND)

----------------------------------------

(5)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(MINUS(x, y))

and relative ADPs:

   le(s(x), s(y)) -> le(x, y)
   le(s(x), 0) -> false
   gcd(s(x), 0) -> s(x)
   if_gcd(true, s(x), s(y)) -> gcd(minus(x, y), s(y))
   rand(x) -> rand(s(x))
   if_gcd(false, s(x), s(y)) -> gcd(minus(y, x), s(x))
   pred(s(x)) -> x
   gcd(0, y) -> y
   gcd(s(x), s(y)) -> if_gcd(le(y, x), s(x), s(y))
   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(minus(x, y))
   le(0, y) -> true
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   rand(x) -> x


----------------------------------------

(6) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:s_1 = 
MINUS_2 = 
true = 
gcd_2 = 
pred_1 = 
le_2 = 
0 = 
minus_2 = 1
if_gcd_3 = 0
rand_1 = 
false = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
MINUS(x1, x2)  =  MINUS(x1, x2)

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

if_gcd(x1, x2, x3)  =  if_gcd(x2, x3)

true  =  true

gcd(x1, x2)  =  gcd(x1, x2)

minus(x1, x2)  =  x1

false  =  false

le(x1, x2)  =  le(x1, x2)

0  =  0

pred(x1)  =  x1


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: s_1 > MINUS_2
s_1 > [if_gcd_2, gcd_2] > le_2 > true
s_1 > [false, 0] > true

if_gcd_2: multiset status

(28) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:true = 
IF_GCD_3 = 0
gcd_2 = 
pred_1 = 
if_gcd_3 = 0
rand_1 = 
GCD_2 = 
false = 
s_1 = 
le_2 = 0, 1
0 = 
minus_2 = 1

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
IF_GCD(x1, x2, x3)  =  IF_GCD(x2, x3)

false  =  false

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

GCD(x1, x2)  =  GCD(x1, x2)

minus(x1, x2)  =  minus(x1)

le(x1, x2)  =  le

true  =  true

pred(x1)  =  x1

0  =  0

gcd(x1, x2)  =  gcd(x1, x2)

if_gcd(x1, x2, x3)  =  if_gcd(x2, x3)


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: [s_1, 0] > [IF_GCD_2, false, GCD_2, le] > true > minus_1 > [gcd_2, if_gcd_2]

Status: IF_GCD_2: multiset status
false: multiset status
s_1: multiset status
GCD_2: multiset status
minus_1: multiset status
le: []
true: multiset status
0: multiset status
gcd_2: multiset status
if_gcd_2: multiset status

Termination of the given RelTRS could be disproven:

(0) RelTRS
(1) RelTRSLoopFinderProof [COMPLETE, 0 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   a -> b

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   b -> a


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRSLoopFinderProof (COMPLETE)
The following loop was found:

---------- Loop: ----------

b -> a with rule b -> a at position [] and matcher [ ]

a -> b with rule a -> b at position [] and matcher [ ]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

Therefore, the relative TRS problem does not terminate.

(2)
NO

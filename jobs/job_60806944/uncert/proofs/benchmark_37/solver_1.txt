(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(s(x), s(y)) -> minus(x, y)
   quot(0, s(y)) -> 0
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(quot(minus(x, y), s(y)))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   rand(x) -> rand(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(s(x), s(y)) -> MINUS(x, y)
   quot(0, s(y)) -> 0
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(QUOT(minus(x, y), s(y)))
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(quot(MINUS(x, y), s(y)))

and relative ADPs:

   rand(x) -> RAND(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  2 SCCs with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 2 subproblems.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Complex Obligation (AND)

----------------------------------------

(5)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   minus(s(x), s(y)) -> MINUS(x, y)

and relative ADPs:

   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(quot(minus(x, y), s(y)))
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   rand(x) -> rand(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x
   quot(0, s(y)) -> 0


----------------------------------------

(6) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:s_1 = 
MINUS_2 = 1
0 = 
minus_2 = 1
rand_1 = 
quot_2 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
MINUS(x1, x2)  =  x1

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

quot(x1, x2)  =  quot(x1, x2)

minus(x1, x2)  =  x1

0  =  0


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: quot_2 > [s_1, 0]

Status: s_1: multiset status
quot_2: [2,1]
0: multiset status

   minus(s0(x)) -> minus(x)
   minus(x) -> x
   rand0(x) -> rand0(s0(x))
   rand0(x) -> x
   quot0(00, s0(y)) -> 00

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(8) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

   quot0(00, s0(y)) -> 00

Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   pred(s(x)) -> x
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(minus(x, y))
   quot(0, s(y)) -> 0
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(quot(minus(x, y), s(y)))
   log(s(0)) -> 0
   log(s(s(x))) -> s(log(s(quot(x, s(s(0))))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   rand(x) -> rand(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   pred(s(x)) -> x
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   minus(x, s(y)) -> PRED(minus(x, y))
   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(MINUS(x, y))
   quot(0, s(y)) -> 0
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(QUOT(minus(x, y), s(y)))
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(quot(MINUS(x, y), s(y)))
   log(s(0)) -> 0
   log(s(s(x))) -> s(LOG(s(quot(x, s(s(0))))))
   log(s(s(x))) -> s(log(s(QUOT(x, s(s(0))))))

and relative ADPs:

   rand(x) -> RAND(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  3 SCCs with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 3 subproblems.

Complex Obligation (AND)

----------------------------------------

(5)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(MINUS(x, y))

and relative ADPs:

   log(s(0)) -> 0
   quot(s(x), s(y)) -> s(quot(minus(x, y), s(y)))
   minus(x, s(y)) -> pred(minus(x, y))
   log(s(s(x))) -> s(log(s(quot(x, s(s(0))))))
   minus(x, 0) -> x
   rand(x) -> rand(s(x))
   rand(x) -> x
   pred(s(x)) -> x
   quot(0, s(y)) -> 0


----------------------------------------

(6) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:s_1 = 
MINUS_2 = 0
log_1 = 
pred_1 = 
0 = 
minus_2 = 1
rand_1 = 
quot_2 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
MINUS(x1, x2)  =  x2

s(x1)  =  s(x1)

quot(x1, x2)  =  quot(x1, x2)

minus(x1, x2)  =  x1

pred(x1)  =  x1

0  =  0

We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(8) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.


Strictly oriented rules of the TRS R:

   log0(s0(00)) -> 00

----------------------------------------

(12) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   LOG0(s0(s0(x))) -> LOG0(s0(quot(x)))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
LOG0(x1)  =  LOG0(x1)

s0(x1)  =  s0(x1)

quot(x1)  =  x1

minus(x1)  =  x1

pred0(x1)  =  x1

log0(x1)  =  log0(x1)

rand0(x1)  =  rand0

00  =  00


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: LOG0_1 > s0_1
log0_1 > s0_1

Status: LOG0_1: multiset status
s0_1: multiset status
log0_1: multiset status
rand0: multiset status
00: multiset status


The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   quot(s0(x)) -> s0(quot(minus(x)))
   minus(x) -> pred0(minus(x))
   log0(s0(s0(x))) -> s0(log0(s0(quot(x))))
   minus(x) -> x
   rand0(x) -> rand0(s0(x))
   pred0(s0(x)) -> x
   quot(00) -> 00

Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   quot(s0(x)) -> s0(quot(minus(x)))
   minus(x) -> pred0(minus(x))
   log0(s0(s0(x))) -> s0(log0(s0(quot(x))))
   minus(x) -> x
   rand0(x) -> rand0(s0(x))
   pred0(s0(x)) -> x
   quot(00) -> 00

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(36) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.

Termination of the given RelTRS could be disproven:

(0) RelTRS
(1) RelTRSLoopFinderProof [COMPLETE, 2 ms]
(2) NO


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   f(s(x)) -> f(x)

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   inf -> s(inf)


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRSLoopFinderProof (COMPLETE)
The following loop was found:

---------- Loop: ----------

f(inf) -> f(s(inf)) with rule inf -> s(inf) at position [0] and matcher [ ]

f(s(inf)) -> f(inf) with rule f(s(x)) -> f(x) at position [] and matcher [x / inf]

Now an instance of the first term with Matcher [ ] occurs in the last term at position [].

Context: []

Therefore, the relative TRS problem does not terminate.

(2)
NO

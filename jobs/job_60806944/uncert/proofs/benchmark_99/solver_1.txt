Termination of the given RelTRS could be proven:

(0) RelTRS
(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) RelADPP
(3) RelADPReductionPairProof [EQUIVALENT, 43 ms]
(4) RelADPP
(5) DAbsisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   T(I(x), y) -> T(x, y)

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   T(x, y) -> T(x, I(y))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   T(I(x), y) -> T^1(x, y)

and relative ADPs:

   T(x, y) -> T^1(x, I(y))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPReductionPairProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the reduction pair processor [IJCAR24].
The following rules can be oriented strictly (l^# > ann(r)) 
and therefore we can remove all of its annotations in the right-hand side:
Absolute ADPs:

   T(I(x), y) -> T^1(x, y)


The remaining rules can at least be oriented weakly:

Ordered with Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(I(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(T(x_1, x_2)) = 3*x_1
   POL(T^1(x_1, x_2)) = 3*x_1

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
No absolute ADPs, and relative ADPs:

   T(I(x), y) -> T(x, y)
   T(x, y) -> T^1(x, I(y))


----------------------------------------

(5) DAbsisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The relative ADP Problem has an empty P_abs. Hence, no infinite chain exists.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

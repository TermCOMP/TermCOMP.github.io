----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Relative term rewrite system:
The relative TRS consists of the following R rules:

   f(g(f(x))) -> f(g(g(g(f(x)))))

The relative TRS consists of the following S rules:

   g(x) -> g(g(x))


----------------------------------------

(1) RelTRStoRelADPProof (EQUIVALENT)


We upgrade the RelTRS problem to an equivalent Relative ADP Problem [IJCAR24].

----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   f(g(f(x))) -> F(g(g(g(f(x)))))
   f(g(f(x))) -> f(G(g(g(f(x)))))
   f(g(f(x))) -> f(g(G(g(f(x)))))
   f(g(f(x))) -> f(g(g(G(f(x)))))
   f(g(f(x))) -> f(g(g(g(F(x)))))

and relative ADPs:

   g(x) -> G(G(x))


----------------------------------------

(3) RelADPDepGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the relative dependency graph processor [IJCAR24].
The approximation of the Relative Dependency Graph contains:
  1 SCC with nodes from P_abs,
  0 Lassos,
Result: This relative DT problem is equivalent to 1 subproblem.

----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Relative ADP Problem with
absolute ADPs:

   f(g(f(x))) -> f(g(g(g(F(x)))))
   f(g(f(x))) -> F(g(g(g(f(x)))))

and relative ADPs:

   f(g(f(x))) -> f(g(g(g(f(x)))))
   g(x) -> g(g(x))


----------------------------------------

(5) RelADPCleverAfsProof (SOUND)
We use the first derelatifying processor [IJCAR24].
There are no annotations in relative ADPs, so the relative ADP problem can be transformed into a non-relative DP problem.

Furthermore, We use an argument filter [LPAR04].
Filtering:f_1 = 
F_1 = 
g_1 = 

Found this filtering by looking at the following order that orders at least one DP strictly:Combined order from the following AFS and order.
F(x1)  =  F(x1)

g(x1)  =  x1

f(x1)  =  f(x1)


Recursive path order with status [RPO].
Quasi-Precedence: F_1 > f_1

Status: F_1: [1]
f_1: multiset status


----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F0(g0(f0(x))) -> F0(x)
   F0(g0(f0(x))) -> F0(g0(g0(g0(f0(x)))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f0(g0(f0(x))) -> f0(g0(g0(g0(f0(x)))))
   g0(x) -> g0(g0(x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(7) MRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the rule removal processor [LPAR04] with the following ordering, at least one Dependency Pair or term rewrite system rule of this QDP problem can be strictly oriented.

Strictly oriented dependency pairs:

   F0(g0(f0(x))) -> F0(x)


Used ordering: Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(F0(x_1)) = 2*x_1
   POL(f0(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(g0(x_1)) = x_1


----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F0(g0(f0(x))) -> F0(g0(g0(g0(f0(x)))))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f0(g0(f0(x))) -> f0(g0(g0(g0(f0(x)))))
   g0(x) -> g0(g0(x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(9) QDPOrderProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the reduction pair processor [LPAR04,JAR06].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   F0(g0(f0(x))) -> F0(g0(g0(g0(f0(x)))))
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO,RATPOLO]:

   POL(F0(x_1)) = [4]x_1
   POL(f0(x_1)) = [4] + [1/4]x_1
   POL(g0(x_1)) = [1/2]x_1
The value of delta used in the strict ordering is 6.
The following usable rules [FROCOS05] with respect to the argument filtering of the ordering [JAR06] were oriented:

   f0(g0(f0(x))) -> f0(g0(g0(g0(f0(x)))))
   g0(x) -> g0(g0(x))


----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Q DP problem:
P is empty.
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f0(g0(f0(x))) -> f0(g0(g0(g0(f0(x)))))
   g0(x) -> g0(g0(x))

Q is empty.
We have to consider all (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(11) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R) chain.
----------------------------------------

(12)
YES

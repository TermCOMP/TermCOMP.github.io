Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 1, 4, 5 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 5: 1+4*arg1+6*arg2
      RF for loc. 6: 4*arg1+6*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 12
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 5: 1
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 14, 17, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -4*x0_0+2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 12: -3-2*x0_0+2*x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14, 17: 0

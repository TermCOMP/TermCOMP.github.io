Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 41, 43, 44 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 30: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 43: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 1
      RF for loc. 30: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 41: 1
 * Removed transitions 31, 34, 35 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 26: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      RF for loc. 26: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 0
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 9, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg3P, bound 0
 * For cutpoint 10, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg3P, bound 0
 * For cutpoint 11, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg2P, bound 0

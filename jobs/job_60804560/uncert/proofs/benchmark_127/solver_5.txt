Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 45 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+3*arg1
      RF for loc. 15: 2+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 24: 3*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      RF for loc. 24: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 0
 * Removed transitions 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 21, 22 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 16: 2+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 20: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9, 17: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 20: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 20: -1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 1
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0

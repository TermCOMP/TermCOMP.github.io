Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 41, 43, 44 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 16: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 43: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 16: -1+2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 41: 0
 * Removed transitions 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 2+3*arg4
      RF for loc. 11: 3*arg4
      RF for loc. 12: 1+3*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 4

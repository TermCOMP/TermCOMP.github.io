Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1-2*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 8: -2*x_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0

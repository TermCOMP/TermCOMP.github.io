Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 17, 18, 20, 21 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: -1+x0_0+x1_0
      RF for loc. 13: x0_0+x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16, 17, 18: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 0

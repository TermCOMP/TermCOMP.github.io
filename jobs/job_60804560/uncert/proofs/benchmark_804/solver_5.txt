Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 47, 49, 51, 52 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 21: -1-2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 31: -2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 51: -126
      Bound for (chained) transitions 52: -126
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      RF for loc. 31: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 47, 49: 0
 * Removed transitions 31, 33, 35, 36 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 17: -1+2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 23: 2*x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      RF for loc. 23: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31, 33: 0
 * Removed transitions 39, 41, 43, 44 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 19: -1+2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 27: 2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 43: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      RF for loc. 27: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 39, 41: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 25, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1-2*i_21_0+2*l_20_0
      RF for loc. 19: -2*i_21_0+2*l_20_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: -2*i_21_0+2*rv_13_0
      RF for loc. 19: -1-2*i_21_0+2*rv_13_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 15: 1
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 1
 * Removed transitions 54, 56, 57 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 18: 1-2*i_16_0+2*i_259_0
      RF for loc. 31: -2*i_16_0+2*i_259_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 57: -2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 18: -2*i_16_0+2*i_259_0
      RF for loc. 31: -1-2*i_16_0+2*i_259_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 56: -3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 18: 0
      RF for loc. 31: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 54: 0

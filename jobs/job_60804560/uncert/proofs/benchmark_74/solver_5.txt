Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 16: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 16: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 1
 * Removed transitions 33, 36, 37 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 20: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 37: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 0

Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 16, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF 2*n_0+j_0-2*i_0, bound 1
    - RF n_0-i_0, bound 1
 * For cutpoint 20, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF n_0-i_0, bound 1

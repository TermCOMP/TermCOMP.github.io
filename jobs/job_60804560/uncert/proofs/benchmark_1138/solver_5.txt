Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 3, 5, 6, 11, 12 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: y_0
      RF for loc. 7: y_0
      RF for loc. 8: y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 2+3*x_0
      RF for loc. 7: 3*x_0
      RF for loc. 8: 1+3*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 1
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 8, 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

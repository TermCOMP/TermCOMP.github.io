Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 7, 8, 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: arg2
      RF for loc. 7: arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*arg1+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 7: 2*arg1+4*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 4
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 7: -1+2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 1
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 0

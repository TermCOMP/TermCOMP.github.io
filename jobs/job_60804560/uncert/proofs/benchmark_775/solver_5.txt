Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 39, 41, 42 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 6*x0_0-6*x1_0
      RF for loc. 15: 6*x0_0-6*x1_0
      RF for loc. 19: 6*x0_0-6*x1_0
      RF for loc. 20: 6*x0_0-6*x1_0
      RF for loc. 24: 2+6*x0_0-6*x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 41: 8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 42: 8
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: -4+5*x0_0-5*x1_0-5*x2_0
      RF for loc. 15: 1+5*x0_0-5*x1_0-5*x2_0
      RF for loc. 19: -3+5*x0_0-5*x1_0-5*x2_0
      RF for loc. 20: 5*x0_0-5*x1_0-5*x2_0
      RF for loc. 24: -1+5*oldX0_post-5*oldX1_post-5*oldX2_post
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 5
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 14: 2
      RF for loc. 15: 1
      RF for loc. 19: 3
      RF for loc. 20: 0
      RF for loc. 24: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22, 25: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23, 29, 39: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 7, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 2*___const_20_0+-1-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 11: 2*___const_20_0-2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 7: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 11: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

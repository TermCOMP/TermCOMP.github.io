Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 1, 3, 4 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*i4_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2*i4_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 1
 * Removed transitions 9, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1-2*i3_0+2*n_0
      RF for loc. 16: -2*i3_0+2*n_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
 * Removed transitions 19, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*i2_0
      RF for loc. 20: 2*i2_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
 * Removed transitions 29, 32, 33 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1-2*i1_0+2*n_0
      RF for loc. 24: -2*i1_0+2*n_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 24: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0

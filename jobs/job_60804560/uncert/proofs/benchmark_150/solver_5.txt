Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 56, 59, 60 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 23: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 56: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 59: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 60: 0
 * Removed transitions 40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1-2*arg2+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 19: -2*arg2+2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 46: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 47: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 48: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 40: 1
 * Removed transitions 22, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 1
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 1

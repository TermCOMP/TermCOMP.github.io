Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: -1+2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 13: 2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11, 12, 13: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0

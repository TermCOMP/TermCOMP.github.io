Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 24, 26, 27, 32, 33, 35, 36 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -4*arg2+4*arg4
      RF for loc. 20: 3-4*arg2+4*arg3
      RF for loc. 24: -4*arg2+4*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 7
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -arg1P
      RF for loc. 24: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24, 32: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 11: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 24: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 2

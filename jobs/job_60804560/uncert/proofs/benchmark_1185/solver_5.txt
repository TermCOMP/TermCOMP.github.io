Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*a_347_0
      RF for loc. 17: 2*a_347_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 1
 * Removed transitions 30, 32, 33 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: 1+2*a_210_0
      RF for loc. 25: 2*a_210_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      RF for loc. 25: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
 * Removed transitions 19, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1-2*i_33_0+2*length_32_0
      RF for loc. 21: -2*i_33_0+2*length_32_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 1

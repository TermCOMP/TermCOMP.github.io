Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 3*arg3-3*arg4
      RF for loc. 7: 3*arg3-3*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 3

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 39, 42, 43 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 39: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 42: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 43: 0
 * Removed transitions 31, 33, 34 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1+2*arg2-2*arg3
      RF for loc. 17: 2*arg2-2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 1
 * Removed transitions 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+arg11+arg17
      RF for loc. 13: arg11+arg17
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: arg7
      RF for loc. 13: -1+arg7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0

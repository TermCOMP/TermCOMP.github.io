Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 1, 4, 5 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 5: arg2
      RF for loc. 6: arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 5: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 6: -1+2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 5: 1
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 7, 10, 11, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 5*arg1+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 1+3*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 9: 1+5*arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 10: -1+5*arg1+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 14: 3*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 18: 1+5*arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 9: 2*arg2
      RF for loc. 10: -2
      RF for loc. 14: 2*arg2
      RF for loc. 18: -1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*arg2
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 14: -1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 18: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 0
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 14: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 11, 13, 14, 19, 20, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 9*i_0
      RF for loc. 15: -7+9*i_0
      RF for loc. 16: -7+9*i_0
      RF for loc. 17: -7+9*i_0
      RF for loc. 18: -7+9*i_0
      RF for loc. 19: 1+9*i_0
      RF for loc. 23: -7+9*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 4+3*i_0+2*i_post-5*j_0
      RF for loc. 15: -2+5*i_0-5*j_0
      RF for loc. 16: 2+5*i_0-5*j_0
      RF for loc. 17: 5*i_0-5*j_0
      RF for loc. 18: -1+5*i_0-5*j_0
      RF for loc. 19: 5+3*i_0+2*i_post-5*j_0
      RF for loc. 23: 1+5*i_0-5*j_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 5
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 14: -3
      RF for loc. 15: 2
      RF for loc. 16: 1
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      RF for loc. 18: 3
      RF for loc. 19: -2
      RF for loc. 23: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11, 30: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 3

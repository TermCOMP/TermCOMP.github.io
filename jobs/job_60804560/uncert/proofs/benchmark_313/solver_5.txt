Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 15, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
 * Removed transitions 1, 5, 6 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 8: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 0

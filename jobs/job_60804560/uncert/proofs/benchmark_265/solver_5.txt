Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 50 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 3*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 13: -2+3*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 22: -1+3*arg1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 50: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      RF for loc. 22: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0
 * Removed transitions 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:

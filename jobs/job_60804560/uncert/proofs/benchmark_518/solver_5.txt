Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -2-4*j_0
      RF for loc. 12: -3-4*j_0
      RF for loc. 13: -1-4*j_0
      RF for loc. 15: -4*j_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: -13
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 2
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12, 20: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0

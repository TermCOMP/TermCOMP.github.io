Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 19, 20, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -1+2*a_243_0
      RF for loc. 16: 2*a_243_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16, 23: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0
 * Removed transitions 6, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1-2*i_8_0+2*length_7_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2*i_8_0+2*length_7_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 1

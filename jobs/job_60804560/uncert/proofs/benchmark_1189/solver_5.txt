Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 23, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: 1+2*a_279_0
      RF for loc. 21: 2*a_279_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      RF for loc. 21: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
 * Removed transitions 30, 32, 33 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*a_174_0
      RF for loc. 25: 2*a_174_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 25: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
 * Removed transitions 12, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1-2*i_31_0+2*length_29_0
      RF for loc. 17: -2*i_31_0+2*length_29_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 14, 16, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -i13_0+n12_0
      RF for loc. 17: -i13_0+n12_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13, 14: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 17: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -2*i10_0+2*n9_0
      RF for loc. 13: -2*i10_0+2*n9_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5, 23: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 13: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0

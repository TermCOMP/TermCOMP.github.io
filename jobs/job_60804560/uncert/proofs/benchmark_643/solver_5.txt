Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 24, 25, 27, 28 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 21: -1-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 33: -2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24, 25: -199
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 21: -1
      RF for loc. 33: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 0

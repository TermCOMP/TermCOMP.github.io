Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 15, 26, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: -1-2*ni21_0
      RF for loc. 25: -2*ni21_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15, 26: -5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 25: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 25: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 0
 * Removed transitions 16, 18, 19, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: -1-2*ni16_0
      RF for loc. 21: -2*ni16_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16, 25: -5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
 * Removed transitions 7, 9, 10, 35 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: -1-2*ni11_0
      RF for loc. 17: -2*ni11_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7, 35: -5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

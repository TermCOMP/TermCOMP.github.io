Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 6, 8, 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: -1-2*counter_0
      RF for loc. 10: -2*counter_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5, 6: -71
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

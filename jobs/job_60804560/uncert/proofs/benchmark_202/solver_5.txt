Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 22, 24, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 21: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 21: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0
 * Removed transitions 14, 16, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 17: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0
 * Removed transitions 4, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 13: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 0

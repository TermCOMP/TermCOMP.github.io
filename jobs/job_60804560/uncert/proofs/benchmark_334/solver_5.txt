Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 17, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 19: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 23: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17, 25: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 1-2*arg2+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 23: -2*arg2+2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 23: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 0
 * Removed transitions 32, 35, 36, 44, 45, 46, 47, 50, 51 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: arg1+arg2+arg3
      RF for loc. 17: 1+arg6+2*arg7
      RF for loc. 18: 2*arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 27: -1+arg1+arg2+arg3
      RF for loc. 31: -1+2*arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 46: 9
      Bound for (chained) transitions 50: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 51: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      RF for loc. 18: 0
      RF for loc. 27: -2
      RF for loc. 31: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 47: 0

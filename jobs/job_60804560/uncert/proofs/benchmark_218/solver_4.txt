NO


NON-Termination:
----------------
SCC:
+--transitions: t1
+--nodes: f61_0_main_GE
Closed walk: 1 -> t1
deterministic: Forced for: arg1P, arg1P, arg1P, Local0, Local0
Reachability checked!
- Recurrent Set Found:
{
	Local0 == 0,
	arg3 -arg3P == 0,
	arg2 -arg2P == 0,
	-1 + arg1P == 0,
	-1 + arg1 == 0,
	-1 -arg2 + arg3 >= 0,
	arg2 >= 0

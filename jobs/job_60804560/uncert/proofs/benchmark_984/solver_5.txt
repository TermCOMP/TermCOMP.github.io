Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 7, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*i_5_0
      RF for loc. 7: 2*i_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 202
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 202
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0

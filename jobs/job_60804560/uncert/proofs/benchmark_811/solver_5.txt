Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: -2-4*x_0
      RF for loc. 9: 1-4*x_0
      RF for loc. 10: -1-4*x_0
      RF for loc. 11: -4*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: -13
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*x_0
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 11: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 1

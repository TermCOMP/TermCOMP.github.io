Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+arg3+arg4-arg5
      RF for loc. 14: arg3+arg4-arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 14: 2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 14: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0
 * Removed transitions 3, 5, 6 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 10: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*arg2
      RF for loc. 10: -1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 24, 25, 27, 28 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 21: 2*___const_100_0+-1-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 33: 2*___const_100_0-2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24, 25: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      RF for loc. 33: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 1

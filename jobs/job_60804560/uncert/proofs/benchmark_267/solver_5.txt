Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 2*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4, 12: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: 1-2*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -2*arg1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 2
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 7: 1-2*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -2*arg1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
    - Rank function 5:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 0

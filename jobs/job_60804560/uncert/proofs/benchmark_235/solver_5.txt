Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 48 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg3
      RF for loc. 24: -1+2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 48: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 4+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 24: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 24: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
 * Removed transitions 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 16: 2+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 20: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12, 20: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 20: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 20: -1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 1
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 0

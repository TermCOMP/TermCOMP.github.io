Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: -4*arg1
      RF for loc. 8: 3-4*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: -4*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: -393
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: -393
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 1-3*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: -3*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -3*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: -297
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: -294
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5, 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0

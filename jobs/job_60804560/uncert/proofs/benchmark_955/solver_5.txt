Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1-2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 7: -2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

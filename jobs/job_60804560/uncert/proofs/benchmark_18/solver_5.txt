Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 12, 15, 16, 24, 25, 26, 27 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 2+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 11: 4*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -1+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 13: 1+4*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 9
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 9
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 7
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 32, 34, 35, 40, 41, 44, 45, 50 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 3*arg1
      RF for loc. 16: 1+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 25: 3*arg1
      RF for loc. 29: -1+3*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32, 40: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 50: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 29: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 41: 0
 * Removed transitions 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 26, 27 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 17: 2+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 21: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14, 22: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 21: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 21: -1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 1
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 21: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0

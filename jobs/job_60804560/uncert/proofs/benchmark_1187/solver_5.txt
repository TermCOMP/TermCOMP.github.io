Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 27, 29, 30 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: 1+2*a_149_0+2*a_281_0
      RF for loc. 22: 2*a_149_0+2*a_281_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 1+2*a_149_0+2*a_281_0
      RF for loc. 22: 2*a_149_0+2*a_281_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 16: 1
      RF for loc. 22: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 1
 * Removed transitions 34, 36, 37 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 17: 1+2*a_149_0
      RF for loc. 26: 2*a_149_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 37: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 17: 2*a_149_0
      RF for loc. 26: -1+2*a_149_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 17: 1
      RF for loc. 26: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 1
 * Removed transitions 20, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1-2*i_30_0+2*length_28_0
      RF for loc. 18: -2*i_30_0+2*length_28_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 1-2*i_30_0+2*length_28_0
      RF for loc. 18: -2*i_30_0+2*length_28_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 18: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0

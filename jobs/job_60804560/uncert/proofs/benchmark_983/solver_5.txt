Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 7, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: -2*___const_101_0+1+2*i_5_0
      RF for loc. 7: -2*___const_101_0+2*i_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 1
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 1

Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 7, 10, 11, 14 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -1+2*maxRetries_9_0-2*retryCount_10_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2*maxRetries_9_0-2*retryCount_10_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7, 14: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 15, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: 1+2*a_264_0
      RF for loc. 20: 2*a_264_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
 * Removed transitions 21, 22, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 18: -2*copied_0
      RF for loc. 24: -1-2*copied_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 18: rv_13_0
      RF for loc. 24: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21, 22: 1
 * Removed transitions 29, 32, 33 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 17: 1-2*i_28_0+2*l_27_0
      RF for loc. 28: -2*i_28_0+2*l_27_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      RF for loc. 28: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0

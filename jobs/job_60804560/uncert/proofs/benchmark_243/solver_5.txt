Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 8, 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1-2*arg2+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 12: -2*arg2+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 9, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg4-arg2, bound 1
 * For cutpoint 10, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg4-arg3, bound 1
 * For cutpoint 11, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg4-arg2, bound 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 33, 34, 35, 37, 38 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 20: -1+2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 25: 2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33, 34, 35: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      RF for loc. 25: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 37: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 38: 0
 * Removed transitions 25, 27, 29, 30 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: -1+2*x2_0
      RF for loc. 21: 2*x2_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      RF for loc. 21: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25, 27: 0

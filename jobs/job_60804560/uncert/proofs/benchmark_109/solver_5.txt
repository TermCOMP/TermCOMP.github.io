Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: arg1+2*arg6
      RF for loc. 8: 3*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: arg1+2*arg6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4, 12: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: -arg3-arg4+2*arg5
      RF for loc. 8: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: -1-arg3-arg4+2*arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: -1

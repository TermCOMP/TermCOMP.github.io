Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 11: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 11: -1+2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 0
 * Removed transitions 12, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg2+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg2+2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 2*arg3
      RF for loc. 15: -1+2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0

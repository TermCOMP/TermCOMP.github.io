Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1-2*i_14_0+2*i_22_0
      RF for loc. 7: -2*i_14_0+2*i_22_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

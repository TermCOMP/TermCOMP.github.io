Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 22, 24, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 2+2*arg1+5*arg2
      RF for loc. 7: 2*arg1+5*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg1+5*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -1+2*arg1+5*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 6
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 2+arg1+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 7: arg1+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 1+arg1+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: arg1+4*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 5
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: -1
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -2
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 0

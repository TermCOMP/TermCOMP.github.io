Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1+4*x1_0
      RF for loc. 13: 3+4*x1_0
      RF for loc. 15: -1+4*x0_0
      RF for loc. 16: 2+4*x1_0
      RF for loc. 20: 4*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 13: -2
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      RF for loc. 16: -3
      RF for loc. 20: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17, 26: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0

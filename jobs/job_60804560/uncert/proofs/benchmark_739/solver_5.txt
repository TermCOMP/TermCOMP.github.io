Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 2*x_0
      RF for loc. 8: 2*x_0
      RF for loc. 12: -1+2*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 3*y_0
      RF for loc. 8: 3*y_0
      RF for loc. 12: -1+3*y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 1
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 11: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 15, 17, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 2+2*x2_0
      RF for loc. 12: 4*x2_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 8
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15, 17: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 19: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 19: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 19: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
 * Removed transitions 15, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 11, 13, 14 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 6, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg3P, bound 0

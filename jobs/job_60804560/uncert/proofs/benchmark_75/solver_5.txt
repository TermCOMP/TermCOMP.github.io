Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 30, 33, 34, 35, 45 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -1+arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: 3*arg2
      RF for loc. 17: -2+arg1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
 * Removed transitions 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 13: 2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0

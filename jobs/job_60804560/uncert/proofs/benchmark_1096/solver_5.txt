Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1-2*i_13_0
      RF for loc. 9: -2*i_13_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: -18
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: -18
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

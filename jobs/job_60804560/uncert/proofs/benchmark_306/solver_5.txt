Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 36, 39, 40 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1+arg1
      RF for loc. 21: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 39: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 40: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 1
 * Removed transitions 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1-arg2+arg3+arg4-arg5
      RF for loc. 13: -arg2+arg3+arg4-arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 0
 * Removed transitions 24, 27, 28 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 2+arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 17: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 6
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 2+4*x_13_0
      RF for loc. 9: 1+4*x_13_0
      RF for loc. 10: 4*x_13_0
      RF for loc. 11: 2+4*x_13_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*y_17_0
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 11: -1+2*y_17_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 15, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: -1+2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 1
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 6, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg2P, bound 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 16, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: arg2
      RF for loc. 14: arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: -2*arg3
      RF for loc. 14: -1-2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 14: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 0
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 10: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 1

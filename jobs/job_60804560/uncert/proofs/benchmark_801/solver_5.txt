Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 19, 21, 23, 24 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: -3-2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 16: -2*x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: -40
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: -40
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19, 21: 0
 * Removed transitions 27, 29, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: -1-2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 20: -2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: -198
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: -198
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27, 29: 0

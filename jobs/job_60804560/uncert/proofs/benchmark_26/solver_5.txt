Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 9, 10, 11, 21 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: -1+arg2+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 10: 3*arg3
      RF for loc. 12: -2+arg2+2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0
 * Removed transitions 22, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+arg1
      RF for loc. 16: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: arg1
      RF for loc. 16: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0

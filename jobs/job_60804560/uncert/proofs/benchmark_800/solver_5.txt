Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 19, 21, 23, 24 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 2*___const_20_0+-3-2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 16: 2*___const_20_0-2*x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19, 21: 0
 * Removed transitions 27, 29, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 2*___const_99_0+-1-2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 20: 2*___const_99_0-2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27, 29: 0

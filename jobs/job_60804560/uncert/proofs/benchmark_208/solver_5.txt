Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 11, 13, 14 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 1
 * Removed transitions 1, 4, 5 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 2*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: -1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 0

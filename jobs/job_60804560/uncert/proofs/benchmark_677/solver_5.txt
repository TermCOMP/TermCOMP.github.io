Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 35 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 17: 4*___const_10_0+-2-4*il_0
      RF for loc. 19: 4*___const_10_0+-1-4*il_0
      RF for loc. 20: 4*___const_10_0-4*il_0
      RF for loc. 25: 4*___const_10_0+1-4*il_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 17: 1
      RF for loc. 19: 2
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      RF for loc. 25: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24, 27: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
 * Removed transitions 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 36 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 3*___const_10_0-3*il_0
      RF for loc. 15: 3*___const_10_0+-1-3*il_0
      RF for loc. 21: 3*___const_10_0+1-3*il_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16, 36: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      RF for loc. 21: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 1

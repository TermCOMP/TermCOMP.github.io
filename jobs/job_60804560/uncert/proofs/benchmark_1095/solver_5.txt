Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*___const_10_0+1-2*i_13_0
      RF for loc. 9: 2*___const_10_0-2*i_13_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

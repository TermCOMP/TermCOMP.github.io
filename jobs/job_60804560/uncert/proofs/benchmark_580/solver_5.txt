Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 11, 12 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*a_163_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2*a_163_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0
 * Removed transitions 15, 18, 19 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1-2*i_27_0+2*length_25_0
      RF for loc. 16: -2*i_27_0+2*length_25_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0

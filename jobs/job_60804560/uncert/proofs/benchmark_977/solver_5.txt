Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -3*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 11: -1-3*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2-3*x_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: -3*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 11: -1-3*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2-3*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 1-3*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 11: -3*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 12: -1-3*x_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 5
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9, 18: 0
    - Rank function 5:
      RF for loc. 10: y_6_0
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 17, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: 4*x_14_0
      RF for loc. 17: 2-4*x_14_0
      RF for loc. 18: -4*x_14_0
      RF for loc. 19: -2-4*x_14_0
      RF for loc. 20: 2+4*x_14_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 6
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: -3+3*b_16_post
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      RF for loc. 18: 0
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -3+3*b_16_post
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 0

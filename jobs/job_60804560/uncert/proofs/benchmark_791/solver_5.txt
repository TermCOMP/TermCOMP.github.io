Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: -1+x0_0+x1_0
      RF for loc. 13: x0_0+x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14, 15, 16: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0

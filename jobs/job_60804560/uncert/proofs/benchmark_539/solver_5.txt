Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*x_0
      RF for loc. 9: -1+2*x_0
      RF for loc. 10: -2+2*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 202

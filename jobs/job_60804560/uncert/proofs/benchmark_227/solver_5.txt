Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 1, 4, 5 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 5: 1-4*arg1+42*arg2
      RF for loc. 6: -4*arg1+42*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: -358
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 5: 10+20*arg2
      RF for loc. 6: 20*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 20
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 5: 0
      RF for loc. 6: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 0

YES
Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: arg4-arg5
      RF for loc. 7: arg4-arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 1
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 6, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF -arg5+arg4, bound 1

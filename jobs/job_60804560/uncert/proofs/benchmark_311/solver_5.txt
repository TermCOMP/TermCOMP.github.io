Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 21, 24, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+arg1
      RF for loc. 12: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+arg1
      RF for loc. 12: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 1
 * Removed transitions 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 8: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 8: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 0

Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 14, 17, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1-2*x1_0+2*x2_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2*x2_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1-2*x1_0+2*x2_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2*x2_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14, 17: 0

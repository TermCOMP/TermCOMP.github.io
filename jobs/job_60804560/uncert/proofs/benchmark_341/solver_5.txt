Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 57, 59, 60 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1+arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 24: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 60: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 24: -1+2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 59: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 24: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 57: 0
 * Removed transitions 15, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 44, 45, 46 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: 2+3*arg1+15*arg2+3*arg3
      RF for loc. 14: 3*arg1+15*arg2+3*arg3
      RF for loc. 16: 1+3*arg1+15*arg2+3*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 46: 0
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 12, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg2P, bound 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: -3-4*nI6_0
      RF for loc. 11: -2-4*nI6_0
      RF for loc. 12: -1-4*nI6_0
      RF for loc. 13: -4*nI6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: -125
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 11: 2
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 10: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 0

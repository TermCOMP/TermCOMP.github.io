Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 7: 2*x_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 2*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 7: -1+2*x_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

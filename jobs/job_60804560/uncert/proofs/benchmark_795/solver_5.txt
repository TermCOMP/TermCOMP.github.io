Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 31, 33, 34 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 2*___const_9_0-2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 16: 2*___const_9_0-2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 20: 2*___const_9_0+1-2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      RF for loc. 20: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16, 21, 31: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 15: 2*___const_11_0-2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 16: 2*___const_11_0+-1-2*x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17, 22: -1
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0

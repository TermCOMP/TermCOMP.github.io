Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 15, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 2*___const_19_0+-1-2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2*___const_19_0-2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13, 15: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 7, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 4*x_13_0-2*y_16_0
      RF for loc. 10: -1+4*x_13_0
      RF for loc. 14: -1+4*x_13_0-2*y_16_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 4*x_13_0-2*y_16_0
      RF for loc. 10: -1+4*x_13_0
      RF for loc. 14: -1+4*x_13_0-2*y_16_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 3*y_16_0
      RF for loc. 10: -1+3*y_16_0
      RF for loc. 14: -1+3*y_16_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 2
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7, 16: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 1

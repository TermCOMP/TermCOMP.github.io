Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 8, 9, 10, 20, 21, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 3+4*arg3
      RF for loc. 8: 1+4*arg3
      RF for loc. 9: 4*arg1
      RF for loc. 10: 2+4*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -2*arg3P
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: -1

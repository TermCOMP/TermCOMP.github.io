Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 46, 48, 49 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 21: x1_0
      RF for loc. 24: x1_0
      RF for loc. 29: x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36, 38: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 21: 1+3*x0_0
      RF for loc. 24: -1+3*x0_0
      RF for loc. 29: 3*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34, 35, 37: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 21: 1
      RF for loc. 24: -1
      RF for loc. 29: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 46: 1

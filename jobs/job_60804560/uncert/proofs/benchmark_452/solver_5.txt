Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 3, 4, 6, 7 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 2*___const_50_0-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 9: 2*___const_50_0-2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3, 4: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0

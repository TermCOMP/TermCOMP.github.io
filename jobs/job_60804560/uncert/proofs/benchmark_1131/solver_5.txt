Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7, 12 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: -1+2*x_0
      RF for loc. 9: 2*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4, 12: 0

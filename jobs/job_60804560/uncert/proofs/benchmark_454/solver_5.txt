Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 15, 17, 18, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 2*___const_50_0+-1-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 17: 2*___const_50_0-2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15, 23: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
 * Removed transitions 6, 7, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 2*___const_50_0+-1-2*i5_0
      RF for loc. 13: 2*___const_50_0-2*i5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 7: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1-2*x_6_0
      RF for loc. 7: -2*x_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: -2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: -2*w_5_0
      RF for loc. 7: -1-2*w_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: -5
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 1
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 1

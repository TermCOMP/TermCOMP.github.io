Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: arg1-arg2+arg4-arg5
      RF for loc. 7: arg1-arg2+arg4-arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1

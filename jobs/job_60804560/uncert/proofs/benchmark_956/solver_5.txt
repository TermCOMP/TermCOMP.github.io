Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1-2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 9: -2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0

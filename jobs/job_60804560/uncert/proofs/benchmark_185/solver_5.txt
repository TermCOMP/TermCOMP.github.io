Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 66, 68, 69 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 19: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 30: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 68: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 69: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 19: 1
      RF for loc. 30: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 66: 1
 * Removed transitions 48, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 21: 1-2*arg2+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 26: -2*arg2+2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 54: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 55: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 56: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 57: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 11, 12 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1-2*i_19_0+2*length_17_0
      RF for loc. 9: -2*i_19_0+2*length_17_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+arg1+arg3
      RF for loc. 8: arg1+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: arg1+arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: arg2+arg3
      RF for loc. 8: 3*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -1+arg2+arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: 1
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4, 12: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 9: 4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 13: -1+4*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 123
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 123
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: -1+2*x_5_0
      RF for loc. 9: 2*x_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 42
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 42
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8, 14: 0

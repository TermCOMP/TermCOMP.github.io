Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 14, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 13: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0
 * Removed transitions 8, 10, 11 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 9: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 8, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: arg6-arg7
      RF for loc. 7: arg6-arg7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 7: 4*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 23, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 18: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 18: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 18: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
 * Removed transitions 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*arg1
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 14: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 14: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: -arg2-arg3
      RF for loc. 10: 1-2*arg1
      RF for loc. 14: -1-arg2-arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: -199
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: -199
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 14: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0

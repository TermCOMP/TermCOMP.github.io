Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 23, 25, 26, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: -1+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 10: 3*arg1
      RF for loc. 16: -2+3*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 1
 * Removed transitions 33, 37, 38 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 20: 2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 38: 2
    - Rank function 2:

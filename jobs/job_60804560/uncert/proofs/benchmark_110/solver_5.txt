Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 2, 5, 6, 7, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 2+3*arg1
      RF for loc. 8: 3*arg1
      RF for loc. 9: 1+3*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 6
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 2
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 2: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 1

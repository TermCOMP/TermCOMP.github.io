Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 66, 68, 69 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 24: 1+arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 34: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 68: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 24: 1+arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 34: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 69: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 24: 0
      RF for loc. 34: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 66: 0
 * Removed transitions 74, 76, 77 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 25: 1+arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 38: arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 76: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 25: arg1+arg2
      RF for loc. 38: -1+arg1+arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 77: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 25: 0
      RF for loc. 38: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 74: 0
 * Removed transitions 27, 30, 31, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 56 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 19: 3+6*arg1+6*arg2+6*arg3
      RF for loc. 20: 2+6*arg1+6*arg2+6*arg3
      RF for loc. 21: 1+6*arg1+6*arg2+6*arg3
      RF for loc. 22: 6*arg1+6*arg2+6*arg3
      RF for loc. 23: 5+6*arg1+6*arg2+6*arg3
      RF for loc. 26: 4+6*arg1+6*arg2+6*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27, 56: 5

      Bound for (chained) transitions 38: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 40: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 41: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 42: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 43: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 46: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 47: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 48: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 49: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 50: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 51: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 19: -1
      RF for loc. 26: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 0
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 17, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg2P, bound 0

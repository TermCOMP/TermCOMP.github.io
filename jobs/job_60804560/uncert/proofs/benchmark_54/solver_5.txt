Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 3, 6, 7, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 2+3*arg1-3*arg2
      RF for loc. 7: 3*arg1-3*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 1+3*arg1-3*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 1
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0

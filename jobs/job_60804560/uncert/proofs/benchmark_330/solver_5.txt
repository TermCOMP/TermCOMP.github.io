Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1+4*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 6+4*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 4*arg1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5, 13: 7
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 10
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 10
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 6
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0

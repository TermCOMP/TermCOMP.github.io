Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 45, 47, 48, 53 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 17: arg1
      RF for loc. 26: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45, 53: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 47: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 48: 2
 * Removed transitions 37, 39, 40 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1+2*arg2

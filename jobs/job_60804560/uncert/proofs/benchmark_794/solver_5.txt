Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 17, 20, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -1+2*x0_0-2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2*x0_0-2*x1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17, 20: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 31, 33, 34 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: -4*x0_0
      RF for loc. 16: -4*x0_0
      RF for loc. 20: 1-4*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: -35
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: -35
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: -2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 16: -1-2*x1_0
      RF for loc. 20: -2-2*oldX1_post
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17, 22: -23
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -12
      RF for loc. 20: -2*oldX1_post
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16, 21, 31: -12
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0

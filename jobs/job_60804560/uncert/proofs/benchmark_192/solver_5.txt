Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 17, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
 * Removed transitions 5, 8, 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg6
      RF for loc. 11: 2*arg6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -2+4*x_0
      RF for loc. 11: -1+4*x_0
      RF for loc. 12: 4*x_0
      RF for loc. 13: -3+4*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 11: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 2
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7, 11: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0

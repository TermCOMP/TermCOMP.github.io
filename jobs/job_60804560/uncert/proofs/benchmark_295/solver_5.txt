Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 1, 4, 5 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 5: 1-2*arg1-2*arg2+4*arg3
      RF for loc. 6: -2*arg1-2*arg2+4*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 5: 2*arg1-2*arg2
      RF for loc. 6: -1+2*arg1-2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 5: 1
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 1

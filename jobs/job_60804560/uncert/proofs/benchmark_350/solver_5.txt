Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 18, 21, 22 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: arg1
      RF for loc. 14: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: arg2
      RF for loc. 14: arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 1
 * Removed transitions 8, 14, 15 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 10: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 2*arg2
      RF for loc. 10: -1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0

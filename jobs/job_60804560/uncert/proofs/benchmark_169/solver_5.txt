Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 3, 6, 7 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0

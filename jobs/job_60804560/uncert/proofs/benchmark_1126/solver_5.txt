Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+5*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 12: 2+5*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 13: 3+5*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 14: -1+5*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 15: 5*x_0+5*y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 10
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 10
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: -2
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      RF for loc. 15: -3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9, 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: -2

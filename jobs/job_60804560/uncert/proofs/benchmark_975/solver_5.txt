Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 3-4*y_0
      RF for loc. 9: 1-4*y_0
      RF for loc. 10: -4*y_0
      RF for loc. 11: 2-4*y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 9
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 3-4*x_0
      RF for loc. 9: 1-4*x_0
      RF for loc. 10: -4*x_0
      RF for loc. 11: 2-4*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 6
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 1
      RF for loc. 9: 3
      RF for loc. 10: 2
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 3
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0

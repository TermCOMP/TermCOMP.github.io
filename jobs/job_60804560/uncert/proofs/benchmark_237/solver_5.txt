Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 8, 9, 14, 19 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 2*arg2-2*arg4
      RF for loc. 8: -1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 2*arg2-2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 14: 0
Used the following cutpoint-specific lexicographic rank functions:
 * For cutpoint 7, used the following rank functions/bounds (in descending priority order):
    - RF arg4, bound 1

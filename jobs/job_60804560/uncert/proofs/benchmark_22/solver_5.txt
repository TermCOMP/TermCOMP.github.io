Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 74, 76, 77 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 20: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 76: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 77: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 1
      RF for loc. 20: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 74: 1

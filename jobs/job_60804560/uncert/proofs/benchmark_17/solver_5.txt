Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 8, 9, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 2+3*arg1
      RF for loc. 8: 3*arg1
      RF for loc. 9: 1+3*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -4*x11
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 1

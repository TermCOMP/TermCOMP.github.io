Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*a_264_0
      RF for loc. 17: 2*a_264_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 1
 * Removed transitions 20, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: 1+2*a_158_0
      RF for loc. 21: 2*a_158_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 1
 * Removed transitions 26, 29, 30 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: 1-2*i_28_0+2*l_27_0
      RF for loc. 25: -2*i_28_0+2*l_27_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 25: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 0

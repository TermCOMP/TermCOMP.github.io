Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 14, 17, 18 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -1-2*x0_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: -20
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: -20
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13, 14: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 7, 16, 18, 19 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -1-2*i20_0
      RF for loc. 17: -2*i20_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7, 16: -15
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 17: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 1
 * Removed transitions 6, 8, 10, 11 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -1-2*i20_0
      RF for loc. 13: -2*i20_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 8: -15
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0

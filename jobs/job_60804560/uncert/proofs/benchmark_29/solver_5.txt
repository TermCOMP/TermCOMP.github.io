Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 33, 36, 37, 45 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1-2*arg2+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 21: -2*arg4+2*arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33, 45: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 37: 2
 * Removed transitions 19, 23, 24 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 17: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 17: -1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
 * Removed transitions 5, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1-2*arg3+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 13: -2*arg3+2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: -2*arg3+2*arg8
      RF for loc. 13: -1-2*arg3+2*arg8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 2, 3, 6, 7 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: x_0
      RF for loc. 8: x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 2*y_0
      RF for loc. 8: -1+2*y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 2, 3: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 1

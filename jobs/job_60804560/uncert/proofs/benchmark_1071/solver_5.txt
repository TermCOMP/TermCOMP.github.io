Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 15, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: -3+5*l_27_0-5*mt_18_0
      RF for loc. 17: -4+5*l_27_0-5*lt_10_0
      RF for loc. 19: 5*l_27_0-5*lt_10_0+5*lt_17_0-5*mt_18_0
      RF for loc. 20: -1+5*l_27_0-5*mt_18_0
      RF for loc. 21: -2+5*l_27_0-5*mt_18_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25, 26: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      RF for loc. 17: -2*l_27_0
      RF for loc. 20: 1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15, 29: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: -1

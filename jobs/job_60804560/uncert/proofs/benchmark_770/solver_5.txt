Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 50, 51 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 19: 1+3*x2_0
      RF for loc. 22: 2+3*x2_0
      RF for loc. 23: 6*x2_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 50: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 51: 6
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 19: -1
      RF for loc. 22: 0
      RF for loc. 23: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 42, 48: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 43, 46: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 1, 3, 4 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 5: 1-2*arg1
      RF for loc. 6: -2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3: -4294967294
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: -4294967294
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 5: 1
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 1

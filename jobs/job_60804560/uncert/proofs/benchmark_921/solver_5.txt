Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 4*x_13_0-2*y_16_0
      RF for loc. 9: -1+4*x_13_0
      RF for loc. 13: -1+4*x_13_0-2*y_16_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 3*y_16_0
      RF for loc. 9: -1+3*y_16_0
      RF for loc. 13: -1+3*y_16_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 1
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4, 14: 1
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 62, 65, 66 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 18: 1
      RF for loc. 29: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 62: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 65: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 66: 0
 * Removed transitions 46, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 20: 1-2*arg2+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 25: -2*arg2+2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 50: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 51: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 52: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 53: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 54: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 20: 1
      RF for loc. 25: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 46: 1
 * Removed transitions 27, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 19: 1+2*arg3
      RF for loc. 21: 2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 37: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 38: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      RF for loc. 21: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 27: 0

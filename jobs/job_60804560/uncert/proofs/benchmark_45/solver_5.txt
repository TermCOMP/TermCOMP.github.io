Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 21, 23, 24 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1-arg3
      RF for loc. 18: -arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: -1000
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: -1000
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 18: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 0
 * Removed transitions 11, 14, 15 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 2-2*arg3
      RF for loc. 14: -2*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: -2000
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: -2000
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 14: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0
 * Removed transitions 1, 4, 5 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: 1-arg2-arg3
      RF for loc. 10: -arg2-arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: -2000
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: -2000
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 1: 0

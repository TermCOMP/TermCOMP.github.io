Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 13, 14, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -1+2*maxRetries_9_0-2*retryCount_10_0
      RF for loc. 13: 2*maxRetries_9_0-2*retryCount_10_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9, 17: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 7, 10, 11 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 7: -x_5_0+y_6_0
      RF for loc. 9: -x_5_0+y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 7: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 1

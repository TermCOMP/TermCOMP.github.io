Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 9, 10 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: x_13_0
      RF for loc. 7: x_13_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*y_17_0
      RF for loc. 7: 2*y_17_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 6
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 20*___const_8_0+-4-5*nI6_0
      RF for loc. 11: 20*___const_8_0+-3-5*nI6_0
      RF for loc. 12: 20*___const_8_0+-1-5*nI6_0
      RF for loc. 13: 20*___const_8_0-5*nI6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1
      RF for loc. 11: 2
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6, 10: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 32, 34, 35 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 19: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 19: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 35: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 1
 * Removed transitions 18, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
 * Removed transitions 9, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg4
      RF for loc. 11: 2*arg4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 25: -3+5*a_243_0
      RF for loc. 26: -4+5*a_243_0
      RF for loc. 28: 5*a_243_0
      RF for loc. 29: -1+5*a_243_0
      RF for loc. 34: -2+5*a_243_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 41: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 46, 47: -4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 25: -3
      RF for loc. 26: -4
      RF for loc. 28: 0
      RF for loc. 29: -1
      RF for loc. 34: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 37, 50: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 40: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 44: -3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 45: -3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 48: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 49: 0
 * Removed transitions 31, 33, 34 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 23: 1-2*i_8_0+2*length_7_0
      RF for loc. 30: -2*i_8_0+2*length_7_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 23: 0
      RF for loc. 30: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 0

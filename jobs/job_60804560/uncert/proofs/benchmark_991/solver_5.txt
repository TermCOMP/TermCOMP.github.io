Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 2*b_7_0-4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 10: -2+2*b_7_0-4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 11: -2-4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 13: -4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1-2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 10: -2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 11: -1-2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 13: -2*x_5_0+2*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12, 13: 0
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 10: b_7_0
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 1

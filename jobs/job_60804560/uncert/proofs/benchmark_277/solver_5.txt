Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: arg1
      RF for loc. 7: arg1
      RF for loc. 8: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: arg2
      RF for loc. 7: arg2
      RF for loc. 8: arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 1

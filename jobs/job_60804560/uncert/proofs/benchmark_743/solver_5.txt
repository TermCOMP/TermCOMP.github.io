Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 6, 8, 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: -1+2*y_0
      RF for loc. 11: 2*y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5, 6: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

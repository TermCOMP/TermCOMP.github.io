Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8, 9, 11, 12 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -1-2*i_0+2*x_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2*i_0+2*x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8, 9: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 1

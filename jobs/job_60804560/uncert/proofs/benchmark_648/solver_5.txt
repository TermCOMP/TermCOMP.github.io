Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 14, 16, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: -1-2*i_0+2*n_0
      RF for loc. 15: -2*i_0+2*n_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13, 14: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 15: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 1

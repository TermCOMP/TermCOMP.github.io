YES


Initial Problem
  Start:  l0
  Program_Vars:  X₀
  Temp_Vars:  x_promoted_1_post
  Locations:  l0, l1, l2
  Return Locations:  
  Transitions:
  t₁: l0(X₀) → l2(x_promoted_1_post) :|: X₀ ≤ x_promoted_1_post ∧ x_promoted_1_post ≤ X₀
  t₀: l2(X₀) → l1(x_promoted_1_post) :|: 0 ≤ x_promoted_1_post ∧ x_promoted_1_post ≤ 0


Preprocessing
  Eliminate variables [X₀] that do not contribute to the problem

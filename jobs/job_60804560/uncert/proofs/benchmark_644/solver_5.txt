Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 21, 22, 24, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: -1+2*i_0-2*j_0
      RF for loc. 22: 2*i_0-2*j_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21, 22: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      RF for loc. 22: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 1
 * Removed transitions 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: -4*i_0+4*k_0
      RF for loc. 15: -1-4*i_0+4*k_0
      RF for loc. 18: 1-4*i_0+4*k_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 4

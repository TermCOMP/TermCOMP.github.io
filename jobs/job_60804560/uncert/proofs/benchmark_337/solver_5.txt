Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 5, 6 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 5: arg4-arg5
      RF for loc. 6: arg4-arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 5: 3*arg4-3*arg5
      RF for loc. 6: 3*arg4-3*arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 6

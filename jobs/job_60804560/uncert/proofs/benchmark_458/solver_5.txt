Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 18, 20, 21, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: -1-2*j_0
      RF for loc. 19: -2*j_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18, 26: -3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0
 * Removed transitions 9, 10, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: -1-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 15: -2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9, 10: -3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0

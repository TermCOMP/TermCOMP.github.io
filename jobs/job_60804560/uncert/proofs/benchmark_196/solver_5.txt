Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 26, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 16: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 16: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 0
 * Removed transitions 8, 11, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 2+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 11: 3*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: 1+3*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -5+6*x0_0
      RF for loc. 12: 6*x0_0
      RF for loc. 13: -4+6*x0_0
      RF for loc. 14: -1+6*x0_0
      RF for loc. 15: 6*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 2
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 13: 3
      RF for loc. 14: -1
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 0

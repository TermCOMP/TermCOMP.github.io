Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -1+4*x0_0
      RF for loc. 11: 2+4*x0_0
      RF for loc. 12: 4*x0_0
      RF for loc. 13: 1+4*x0_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 2
      RF for loc. 11: 1
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 0

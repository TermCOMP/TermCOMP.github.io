Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 0

Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 7, 8 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*i_5_0
      RF for loc. 7: 2*i_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 2*i_5_0
      RF for loc. 7: -1+2*i_5_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: -1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 1
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 1

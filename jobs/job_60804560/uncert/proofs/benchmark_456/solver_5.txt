Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: -3-4*i1_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2-4*i1_0
      RF for loc. 13: -1-4*i1_0
      RF for loc. 14: -4*i1_0
      RF for loc. 15: -4*i1_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: -164
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: -2
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 14: -4
      RF for loc. 15: -3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8, 14: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: -3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: -3

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 12, 14, 15 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 9: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 15: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 2
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
 * Removed transitions 4, 6, 7 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 3+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 11: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 1

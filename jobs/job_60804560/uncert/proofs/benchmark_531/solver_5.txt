Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: -1-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 13: -2*i_0
      RF for loc. 14: -2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10, 13: -5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 11: -1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 0

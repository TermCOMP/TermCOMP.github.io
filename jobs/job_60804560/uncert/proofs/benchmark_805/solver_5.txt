Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 26, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: -1+2*ctr23_0
      RF for loc. 25: 2*ctr23_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9, 26: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 25: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 1
 * Removed transitions 18, 20, 21, 35 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: -1+2*ctr23_0
      RF for loc. 21: 2*ctr23_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18, 35: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 0
 * Removed transitions 8, 10, 12, 13 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: 2*___const_64_0+-1-2*i_0
      RF for loc. 17: 2*___const_64_0-2*i_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8, 10: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 0

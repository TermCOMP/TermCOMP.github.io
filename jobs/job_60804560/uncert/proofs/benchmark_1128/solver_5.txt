Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1+4*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 13: 2+4*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 14: 3+4*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 15: -1+4*x_0+5*y_0
      RF for loc. 16: 4*x_0+5*y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 9
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 9
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: -2
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 15: 1
      RF for loc. 16: -3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12, 16: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: -2

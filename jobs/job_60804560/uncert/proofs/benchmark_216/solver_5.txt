Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8, 10, 11 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 9: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 9: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 4
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 9: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 8: 3-3*x_5_0+3*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 9: 1-3*x_5_0+3*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 10: -3*x_5_0+3*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 11: 2-3*x_5_0+3*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 8: 3-4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 9: 2-4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 10: -4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 11: 3-4*x_5_0+4*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 7
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 8: -2
      RF for loc. 9: 0
      RF for loc. 10: -1
      RF for loc. 11: -3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: -2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 8: 0
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 1

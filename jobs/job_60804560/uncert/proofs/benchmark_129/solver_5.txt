Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 3, 6, 7 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 7: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 6: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 3: 0

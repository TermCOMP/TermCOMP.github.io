Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 33: -3+6*a_152_0
      RF for loc. 34: -4+6*a_152_0
      RF for loc. 35: 1+6*a_175_0
      RF for loc. 36: 6*a_175_0
      RF for loc. 37: -1+6*a_175_0
      RF for loc. 39: -2+6*a_152_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 38: -2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 33: -3+6*a_152_0
      RF for loc. 34: -4+6*a_152_0

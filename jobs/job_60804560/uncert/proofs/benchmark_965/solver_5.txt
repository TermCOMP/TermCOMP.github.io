Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 9, 11, 12 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 1+2*y_6_0
      RF for loc. 7: 2*y_6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 12: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 0

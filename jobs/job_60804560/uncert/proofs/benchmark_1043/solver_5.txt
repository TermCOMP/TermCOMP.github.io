Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 16, 18, 19 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: 1+2*a_215_0
      RF for loc. 15: 2*a_215_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 15: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 0
 * Removed transitions 22, 25, 26 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1-2*i_27_0+2*length_25_0
      RF for loc. 19: -2*i_27_0+2*length_25_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 0
      RF for loc. 19: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0

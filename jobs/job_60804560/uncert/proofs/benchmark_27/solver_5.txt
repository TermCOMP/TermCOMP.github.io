Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 14, 17, 18, 19, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+3*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 2+3*arg2
      RF for loc. 14: 3*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 5
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 0
      RF for loc. 14: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 0
 * Removed transitions 30, 33, 34 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: 1+arg1
      RF for loc. 18: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 3
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: arg1
      RF for loc. 18: arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 34: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 18: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 30: 0

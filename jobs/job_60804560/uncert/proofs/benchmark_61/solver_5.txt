Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 2-4*arg2
      RF for loc. 7: -4*arg2-arg3
      RF for loc. 8: 1-4*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -4*arg2-arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11: -75
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: -76
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: -76
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: 2
      RF for loc. 7: 3*arg3
      RF for loc. 8: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 3*arg3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 10: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 3
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 7: 1-arg4-arg5
      RF for loc. 12: -arg4-arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: -38
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: -38
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 7: 0
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 0

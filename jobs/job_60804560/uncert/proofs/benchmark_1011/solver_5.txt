Termination proof succeeded
Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: x_0
      RF for loc. 7: x_0
      RF for loc. 8: x_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 0

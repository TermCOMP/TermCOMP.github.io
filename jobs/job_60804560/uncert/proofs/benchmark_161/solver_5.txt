Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 29, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 21: 2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 21: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
 * Removed transitions 17, 20, 21 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1-2*arg1+2*arg2
      RF for loc. 17: -2*arg1+2*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 17: 1
 * Removed transitions 5, 8, 9 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 13: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 1
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: -2*y_0+2*z_0
      RF for loc. 8: -1-2*y_0+2*z_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2*y_0+2*z_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: -2*y_0+2*z_0
      RF for loc. 8: -1-2*y_0+2*z_0
      RF for loc. 12: -2*y_0+2*z_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: -2-3*x_0+3*y_0
      RF for loc. 8: -3-3*x_0+3*y_0
      RF for loc. 12: -3*x_0+3*y_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 3
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 3
    - Rank function 4:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 12: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4, 11: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 5: 0

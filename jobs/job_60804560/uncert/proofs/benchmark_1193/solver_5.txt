Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 13, 15, 16 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 17: 1+2*a_330_0
      RF for loc. 20: 2*a_330_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 16: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 17: 1
      RF for loc. 20: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 13: 1
 * Removed transitions 40, 42, 43 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: 1+2*a_241_0
      RF for loc. 32: 2*a_241_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 42: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 43: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      RF for loc. 32: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 40: 0
 * Removed transitions 19, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 18: 1+2*a_147_0
      RF for loc. 24: 2*a_147_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 18: 0
      RF for loc. 24: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 0
 * Removed transitions 29, 32, 33 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 19: 1-2*i_30_0+2*length_29_0
      RF for loc. 28: -2*i_30_0+2*length_29_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 33: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      RF for loc. 28: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 0

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 4, 7, 8, 9, 19, 21, 22, 23 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 6: 2+2*arg1+5*arg2
      RF for loc. 7: 2*arg1+5*arg2
      RF for loc. 8: 1+2*arg1+5*arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -1+2*arg1+5*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 7: 8
      Bound for (chained) transitions 8: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 9: 6
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 6
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 6: -1+2*arg2P+arg2
      RF for loc. 7: 3*arg1
      RF for loc. 8: -2+2*arg2P+arg2
      RF for loc. 12: -2+3*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 6: 0
      RF for loc. 7: 1
      RF for loc. 8: -1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 4: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 19: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 1

Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 28, 29, 31, 32 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 17: -1+2*i8_0
      RF for loc. 27: 2*i8_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28, 29: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      RF for loc. 27: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 31: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 17: -1
      RF for loc. 27: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32: 0
 * Removed transitions 20, 22, 23, 38 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 16: -1+2*i6_0
      RF for loc. 23: 2*i6_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20, 38: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      RF for loc. 23: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 0
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 16: -1
      RF for loc. 23: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 23: 0
 * Removed transitions 11, 12, 14, 15 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 13: -1+2*i34_0
      RF for loc. 19: 2*i34_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 11, 12: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 13: 0
      RF for loc. 19: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 14: 1
    - Rank function 3:
      RF for loc. 13: -1
      RF for loc. 19: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 15: 0

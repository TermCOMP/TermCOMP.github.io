Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 22, 24, 25 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 12: 1-arg2+arg3-arg4+arg5
      RF for loc. 17: -arg2+arg3-arg4+arg5
      Bound for (chained) transitions 24: 2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 25: 2
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 12: 1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 22: 1
 * Removed transitions 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:

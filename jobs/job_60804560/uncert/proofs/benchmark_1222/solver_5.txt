Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 26, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 14: 1+2*x3_0
      RF for loc. 17: 2*x3_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 14: 1
      RF for loc. 17: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 1
 * Removed transitions 32, 34, 36, 37 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 15: -8+2*x2_0
      RF for loc. 21: 2*x2_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 36: 16
      Bound for (chained) transitions 37: 16
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 15: 0
      RF for loc. 21: -1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 32, 34: 0

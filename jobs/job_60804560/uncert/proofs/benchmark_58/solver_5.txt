Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 18, 20, 21 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 10: 1+2*arg1
      RF for loc. 12: 2*arg1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 20: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 21: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 10: 1
      RF for loc. 12: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 18: 1
 * Removed transitions 26, 28, 29 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 11: 2+4*arg2
      RF for loc. 16: 4*arg2
      Bound for (chained) transitions 28: 4
      Bound for (chained) transitions 29: 4
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 11: 1
      RF for loc. 16: 0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 26: 1

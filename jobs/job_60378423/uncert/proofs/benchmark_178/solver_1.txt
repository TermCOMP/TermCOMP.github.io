Obligation:
Termination Graph based on JBC Program:
Exc4.main([Ljava/lang/String;)V: Graph of 47 nodes with 1 SCC.

(5) JBCNonTerm (COMPLETE)
Reached a loop using the following run: 

0:<Exc4.main||0: push 0|| - || ->
YES:  (JL1)
1:<Exc4.main||1: store INT to i|| - ||0>
YES:  (JL1)
2:<Exc4.main||2: load INT i||i: 0|| ->
YES:  (JL1)
Start state of loop: 

[o12(lv_0_0)]
<Exc4.main||2: load INT i||i: i9|| ->
	o12([java.lang.String...]): Object() -->{java.lang.Object...}
	i9: #
YES:  (JL1)


In the loop head node, references [i9] were interesting.

All methods calls in the loop body are side-effect free, hence they can be ignored.

By SMT, we could prove

(T and ((((path1_i9 = path1_i11 and path1_i13 = (path1_i11 + -1) and path1_i13 = path1_i14 and path1_i16 = (path1_i14 + 2) and path1_i16 = res_i9 and path1_i9 = initial_i9) and (T and 20 = 20 and path1_i11 < 20 and T and 10 = 10 and path1_i14 <= 10)) or ((path2_i9 = path2_i11 and path2_i13 = (path2_i11 + -1) and path2_i13 = path2_i15 and path2_i18 = (path2_i15 + 1) and path2_i18 = res_i9 and path2_i9 = initial_i9) and (T and 20 = 20 and path2_i11 < 20 and T and 10 = 10 and path2_i15 > 10))) and (((res1_i9 = res1_i11 and res1_i13 = (res1_i11 + -1) and res1_i13 = res1_i14 and res1_i16 = (res1_i14 + 2) and res_i9 = res1_i9) and !(T and 20 = 20 and res1_i11 < 20 and T and 10 = 10 and res1_i14 <= 10)) and ((res2_i9 = res2_i11 and res2_i13 = (res2_i11 + -1) and res2_i13 = res2_i15 and res2_i18 = (res2_i15 + 1) and res_i9 = res2_i9) and !(T and 20 = 20 and res2_i11 < 20 and T and 10 = 10 and res2_i15 > 10)))))

to be UNSAT. Consequently, the loop will not terminate.

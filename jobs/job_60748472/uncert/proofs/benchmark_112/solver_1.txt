----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Probabilistic term rewrite system:
The TRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   f(s(x)) -> 1 : c(f(x), f(x))
   g -> 3 / 4 : s(g) || 1 / 4 : bot

and uses the innermost rewrite strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) PTRStoPQTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Transformed PTRS into PQTRS. Q is:
   f(s(x)), g
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Probabilistic Q term rewrite system:
The PQTRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   f(s(x)) -> 1 : c(f(x), f(x))
   g -> 3 / 4 : s(g) || 1 / 4 : bot

And Q contains the following terms:
   f(s(x0)), g

----------------------------------------

(3) PQTRStoADPProblemProof (EQUIVALENT)


A PQTRS (R,Q) is innermost AST iff ADP(R) is innermost AST (Chain-Criterion)[FLOPS24].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The ADP Problem has the following rules with active return value flag:

   f(s(x)) -> 1 : c(f(x), f(x))
   g -> 3 / 4 : s(g) || 1 / 4 : bot

The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   F(s(x)) -> 1 : c(F(x), F(x))
   G -> 3 / 4 : s(G) || 1 / 4 : bot


----------------------------------------

(5) AST_ADPDependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the dependency graph processor [FLOPS24].
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 2 SCCs.
----------------------------------------

(6)
Complex Obligation (AND)

----------------------------------------

(7)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The ADP Problem has the following rules with active return value flag:

   f(s(x)) -> 1 : c(f(x), f(x))
   g -> 3 / 4 : s(g) || 1 / 4 : bot

The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   G -> 3 / 4 : s(G) || 1 / 4 : bot


----------------------------------------

(8) AST_ADPUsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the usable rules processor [FLOPS24].
Hence, by the usable rules processor [FLOPS24] we can deactivate the flags for all non-usable rules [FROCOS05]
----------------------------------------

(9)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   G -> 3 / 4 : s(G) || 1 / 4 : bot


----------------------------------------

(10) AST_ADPReductionPairProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the reduction pair processor [FLOPS24].
The following pairs can be oriented strictly and we delete all annotations:

   G -> 3 / 4 : s(G) || 1 / 4 : bot

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly:
none

Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(G) = 2
   POL(bot) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = 0

----------------------------------------

(11)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The set of rules with annotations is empty.

----------------------------------------

(12) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
P contains no annotations anymore. Hence, there exists no infinite P-CT.
----------------------------------------

(13)
YES

----------------------------------------

(14)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The ADP Problem has the following rules with active return value flag:

   f(s(x)) -> 1 : c(f(x), f(x))

   F(s(x)) -> 1 : c(F(x), F(x))


----------------------------------------

(15) AST_ADPUsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)

Hence, by the usable rules processor [FLOPS24] we can deactivate the flags for all non-usable rules [FROCOS05]

(16)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   F(s(x)) -> 1 : c(F(x), F(x))


----------------------------------------

(17) AST_ADPProbabilityRemovalProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the probability removal processor [FLOPS24].
As all rules have a trivial probability (1:r), we can transform it into a non-probabilistic DP problem
----------------------------------------

(18)

Q DP problem:
The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x)) -> F(x)

R is empty.
The set Q consists of the following terms:

   f(s(x0))
   g

We have to consider all minimal (P,Q,R)-chains.
----------------------------------------

(19) QReductionProof (EQUIVALENT)
We deleted the following terms from Q as each root-symbol of these terms does neither occur in P nor in R.[THIEMANN].

   f(s(x0))
   g


----------------------------------------

(20)

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   F(s(x)) -> F(x)

R is empty.
Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(21) QDPSizeChangeProof (EQUIVALENT)
By using the subterm criterion [SUBTERM_CRITERION] together with the size-change analysis [AAECC05] we have proven that there are no infinite chains for this DP problem. 

From the DPs we obtained the following set of size-change graphs:
*F(s(x)) -> F(x)
The graph contains the following edges 1 > 1

(22)
YES

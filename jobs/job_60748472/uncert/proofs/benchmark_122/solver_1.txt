Obligation:
Probabilistic term rewrite system:
The TRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   geo(x) -> 1 / 2 : geo(d(x)) || 1 / 2 : x
   start(x, y) -> 1 : q(geo(s(x)), y, y)
   q(O, s(y), s(z)) -> 1 : O
   d(O) -> 1 : O
   d(s(x)) -> 1 : s(s(d(x)))
   q(s(x), s(y), z) -> 1 : q(x, y, z)
   q(x, O, s(z)) -> 1 : s(q(x, s(z), s(z)))

   q(s(x), s(y), z) -> 1 : q(x, y, z)

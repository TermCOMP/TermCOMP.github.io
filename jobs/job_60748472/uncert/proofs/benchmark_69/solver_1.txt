----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Probabilistic term rewrite system:
The TRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   g(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : f(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : g(a, b, z)
   f(x, y, z) -> 1 : g(x, y, z)

and uses the innermost rewrite strategy.

----------------------------------------

(1) PTRStoPQTRSProof (EQUIVALENT)
Transformed PTRS into PQTRS. Q is:
   g(a, b, z), f(x, y, z)
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Probabilistic Q term rewrite system:
The PQTRS has the following probabilistic rules:

   g(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : f(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : g(a, b, z)
   f(x, y, z) -> 1 : g(x, y, z)

And Q contains the following terms:
   g(a, b, x0), f(x0, x1, x2)

----------------------------------------

(3) PQTRStoADPProblemProof (EQUIVALENT)


A PQTRS (R,Q) is innermost AST iff ADP(R) is innermost AST (Chain-Criterion)[FLOPS24].
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The ADP Problem has the following rules with active return value flag:

   g(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : f(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : g(a, b, z)
   f(x, y, z) -> 1 : g(x, y, z)

The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   G(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : F(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : G(a, b, z)
   F(x, y, z) -> 1 : G(x, y, z)


----------------------------------------

(5) AST_ADPUsableRulesProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the usable rules processor [FLOPS24].
Hence, by the usable rules processor [FLOPS24] we can deactivate the flags for all non-usable rules [FROCOS05]
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   G(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : F(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : G(a, b, z)
   F(x, y, z) -> 1 : G(x, y, z)


----------------------------------------

(7) AST_ADPTransformationProof (EQUIVALENT)
By rule overlap instantiation [FLOPS24] for the rule F(x, y, z) -> 1 : G(x, y, z) we obtained the following new ADPs :

   F(a, b, x2) -> 1 : G(a, b, x2)

and we added the following new probabilistic rules with active return value flag:
none

----------------------------------------

(8)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   G(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : F(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : G(a, b, z)
   F(a, b, x2) -> 1 : G(a, b, x2)


----------------------------------------

(9) AST_ADPDependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the dependency graph processor [FLOPS24].
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] contains 1 SCC with 1 less node.
----------------------------------------

(10)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   G(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : F(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : G(a, b, z)


----------------------------------------

(11) AST_ADPUsableTermsProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the usable terms processor [FLOPS24].
The approximation of the Dependency Graph [LPAR04,FROCOS05,EDGSTAR] gives us the following unusable Terms: 
[F(z, z, z)]
Hence, we can remove the annotations from these terms from every RHS of every ADP
----------------------------------------

(12)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The ADP Problem has the following rules with annotations:

   G(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : f(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : G(a, b, z)


----------------------------------------

(13) AST_ADPReductionPairProof (EQUIVALENT)


We use the reduction pair processor [FLOPS24].
The following pairs can be oriented strictly and we delete all annotations:

   G(a, b, z) -> 1 / 2 : f(z, z, z) || 1 / 2 : G(a, b, z)

The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly:
none

Used ordering:  Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(G(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 1 + 2*x_1 + 2*x_1*x_2 + x_1*x_2*x_3 + x_1*x_3 + 2*x_2 + x_2*x_3 + 2*x_3
   POL(a) = 0
   POL(b) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 0

----------------------------------------

(14)
Obligation:
Probabilistic ADP Problem:
The set of rules with active return value flag is empty.
The set of rules with annotations is empty.

----------------------------------------

(15) PisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
P contains no annotations anymore. Hence, there exists no infinite P-CT.
----------------------------------------

(16)
YES

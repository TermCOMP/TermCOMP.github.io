(0) CSR
(1) CSRRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) CSR
(3) CSRRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 1 ms]
(4) CSR
(5) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(6) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(b, X, c) -> f(X, c, X)
   c -> b

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {2}
b: empty set
c: empty set

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(b, X, c) -> f(X, c, X)
   c -> b

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {2}
b: empty set
c: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(b) = 1
   POL(c) = 2
   POL(f(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2*x_2 + 2*x_3
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   c -> b




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(b, X, c) -> f(X, c, X)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {2}
b: empty set
c: empty set

----------------------------------------

(3) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(b, X, c) -> f(X, c, X)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {2}
b: empty set
c: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(b) = 1
   POL(c) = 0
   POL(f(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = x_1 + x_2
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(b, X, c) -> f(X, c, X)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
R is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

(6)
YES

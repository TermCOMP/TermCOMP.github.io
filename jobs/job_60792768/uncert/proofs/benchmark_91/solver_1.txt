Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   __(__(X, Y), Z) -> __(X, __(Y, Z))
   __(X, nil) -> X
   __(nil, X) -> X
   U11(tt) -> U12(tt)
   U12(tt) -> tt
   isNePal(__(I, __(P, I))) -> U11(tt)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

__: {1, 2}
nil: empty set
U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}
isNePal: {1}

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   __(__(X, Y), Z) -> __(X, __(Y, Z))
   __(X, nil) -> X
   __(nil, X) -> X
   U11(tt) -> U12(tt)
   U12(tt) -> tt
   isNePal(__(I, __(P, I))) -> U11(tt)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

__: {1, 2}
nil: empty set
U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}
isNePal: {1}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U11(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(U12(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(__(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(isNePal(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(nil) = 1
   POL(tt) = 1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   __(X, nil) -> X
   __(nil, X) -> X

   U11(tt) -> U12(tt)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

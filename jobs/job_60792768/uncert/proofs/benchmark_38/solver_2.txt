Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty X)
(STRATEGY CONTEXTSENSITIVE
(c)
(f)
(fSNonEmpty)
(g)
)
(RULES
c -> f(g(c))
f(g(X)) -> g(X)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 c -> f(g(c))
 f(g(X)) -> g(X)
-> The context-sensitive term rewriting system is an orthogonal system. Therefore, innermost cs-termination implies cs-termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 C -> F(g(c))
-> Rules:
 c -> f(g(c))
 f(g(X)) -> g(X)
-> Unhiding Rules:
 Empty

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 C -> F(g(c))
-> Rules:
 c -> f(g(c))
 f(g(X)) -> g(X)
-> Unhiding rules:
 Empty
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

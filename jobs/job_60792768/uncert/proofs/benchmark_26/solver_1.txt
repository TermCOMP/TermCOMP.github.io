----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> cons(0, f(s(0)))
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))
   p(s(0)) -> 0

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {1}
0: empty set
cons: {1}
s: {1}
p: {1}

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(0) -> cons(0, f(s(0)))
   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))
   p(s(0)) -> 0

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {1}
0: empty set
cons: {1}
s: {1}
p: {1}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 2
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = x_1
   POL(f(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(p(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(0) -> cons(0, f(s(0)))
   p(s(0)) -> 0




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {1}
0: empty set
s: {1}
p: {1}

----------------------------------------

(3) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {1}
0: empty set
s: {1}
p: {1}
Used ordering:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(f(x_1)) =  	[[0]] 	 +  	[[1, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(s(x_1)) =  	[[0], [1]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [1, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(0) =  	[[1], [1]]
>>>

   <<<
 POL(p(x_1)) =  	[[0], [0]] 	 +  	[[1, 0], [0, 0]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(s(0)) -> f(p(s(0)))




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
R is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(6)
YES

(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U11(tt, M, N) -> U12(tt, M, N)
   U12(tt, M, N) -> s(plus(N, M))
   plus(N, 0) -> N
   plus(N, s(M)) -> U11(tt, M, N)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}
s: {1}
plus: {1, 2}
0: empty set

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U11(tt, M, N) -> U12(tt, M, N)
   U12(tt, M, N) -> s(plus(N, M))
   plus(N, 0) -> N
   plus(N, s(M)) -> U11(tt, M, N)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}
s: {1}
plus: {1, 2}
0: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 2
   POL(U11(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = x_1 + 2*x_2 + 2*x_3
   POL(U12(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = x_1 + 2*x_2 + 2*x_3
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(tt) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   plus(N, 0) -> N

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U11(tt, M, N) -> U12(tt, M, N)
   U12(tt, M, N) -> s(plus(N, M))
   plus(N, s(M)) -> U11(tt, M, N)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}
s: {1}
plus: {1, 2}

----------------------------------------

(3) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U11(tt, M, N) -> U12(tt, M, N)
   U12(tt, M, N) -> s(plus(N, M))
   plus(N, s(M)) -> U11(tt, M, N)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}
s: {1}
plus: {1, 2}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U11(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2 + x_1 + 2*x_2 + 2*x_3
   POL(U12(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 2 + x_1 + 2*x_2 + 2*x_3
   POL(plus(x_1, x_2)) = 2*x_1 + 2*x_2
   POL(s(x_1)) = 2 + x_1
   POL(tt) = 1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U12(tt, M, N) -> s(plus(N, M))
   plus(N, s(M)) -> U11(tt, M, N)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U11(tt, M, N) -> U12(tt, M, N)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}

----------------------------------------

(5) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   U11(tt, M, N) -> U12(tt, M, N)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

U11: {1}
tt: empty set
U12: {1}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(U11(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 1 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3
   POL(U12(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = x_1 + x_2 + x_3
   POL(tt) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   U11(tt, M, N) -> U12(tt, M, N)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
R is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

(8)
YES

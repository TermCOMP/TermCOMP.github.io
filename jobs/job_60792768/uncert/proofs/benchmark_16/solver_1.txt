Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X), Y) -> f(Y, Y, Y)
   g(b) -> c
   b -> c

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: empty set
g: {1}
b: empty set
c: empty set

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X), Y) -> f(Y, Y, Y)
   g(b) -> c
   b -> c

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: empty set
g: {1}
b: empty set
c: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(b) = 2
   POL(c) = 1
   POL(f(x_1, x_2, x_3)) = 0
   POL(g(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   g(b) -> c
   b -> c




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X), Y) -> f(Y, Y, Y)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: empty set
g: {1}

----------------------------------------

(3) CSDependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Improved CS-DPs [LPAR08] we result in the following initial Q-CSDP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q-restricted context-sensitive dependency pair problem:
The symbols in {g_1} are replacing on all positions.
The symbols in {f_3, F_3} are not replacing on any position.

The ordinary context-sensitive dependency pairs DP_o are:
   F(X, g(X), Y) -> F(Y, Y, Y)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X, g(X), Y) -> f(Y, Y, Y)

Q is empty.

----------------------------------------

(5) QCSDependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Context-Sensitive Dependency Graph [LPAR08] contains 0 SCCs.
The rules F(z0, g(z0), z1) -> F(z1, z1, z1) and F(x0, g(x0), x1) -> F(x1, x1, x1) form no chain, because ECap^mu(F(z1, z1, z1)) = F(z1, z1, z1) does not unify with F(x0, g(x0), x1). 
----------------------------------------

(6)

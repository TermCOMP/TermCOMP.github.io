Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from_2(x) -> cons_0(x, from_1(s_0(x)))
   from_3(x) -> cons_0(x, from_2(s_0(x)))
   from_4(x) -> cons_0(x, from_2(s_0(x)))
   from_1(x) -> cons_1(x, from_1(s_0(x)))
   cons_1(s_0(s_0(x)), xs) -> nil_0

The replacement map contains the following entries:

from_2: empty set
cons_0: {1, 2}
from_1: empty set

from_3: empty set
from_4: empty set

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from_2(x) -> cons_0(x, from_1(s_0(x)))
   from_3(x) -> cons_0(x, from_2(s_0(x)))
   from_4(x) -> cons_0(x, from_2(s_0(x)))
   from_1(x) -> cons_1(x, from_1(s_0(x)))
   cons_1(s_0(s_0(x)), xs) -> nil_0

The replacement map contains the following entries:

from_2: empty set
cons_0: {1, 2}
from_1: empty set
s_0: {1}
from_3: empty set
from_4: empty set
cons_1: empty set
nil_0: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(cons_0(x_1, x_2)) = x_1 + x_2
   POL(cons_1(x_1, x_2)) = 0
   POL(from_1(x_1)) = 0
   POL(from_2(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(from_3(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(from_4(x_1)) = 2 + 2*x_1
   POL(nil_0) = 0
   POL(s_0(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   from_3(x) -> cons_0(x, from_2(s_0(x)))
   from_4(x) -> cons_0(x, from_2(s_0(x)))

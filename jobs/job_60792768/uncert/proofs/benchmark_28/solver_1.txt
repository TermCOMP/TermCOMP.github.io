(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))
   after(0, XS) -> XS
   after(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> after(N, XS)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

from: {1}
cons: {1}
s: {1}
after: {1, 2}
0: empty set

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRInnermostProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR is orthogonal. By [CS_Inn] we can switch to innermost.
----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))
   after(0, XS) -> XS
   after(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> after(N, XS)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

from: {1}
cons: {1}
s: {1}
after: {1, 2}
0: empty set


Innermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(3) CSDependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Improved CS-DPs [LPAR08] we result in the following initial Q-CSDP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q-restricted context-sensitive dependency pair problem:
The symbols in {from_1, s_1, after_2, AFTER_2, FROM_1} are replacing on all positions.
For all symbols f in {cons_2} we have mu(f) = {1}.
The symbols in {U_1} are not replacing on any position.

The ordinary context-sensitive dependency pairs DP_o are:
   AFTER(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> AFTER(N, XS)

The collapsing dependency pairs are DP_c:
   AFTER(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> XS


The hidden terms of R are:

   from(s(x0))

Every hiding context is built from:
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@26061c94
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@714952e2

Hence, the new unhiding pairs DP_u are :
   AFTER(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> U(XS)
   U(s(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(s(x0))) -> FROM(s(x0))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))
   after(0, XS) -> XS
   after(s(N), cons(X, XS)) -> after(N, XS)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   from(x0)
   after(0, x0)
   after(s(x0), cons(x1, x2))


----------------------------------------

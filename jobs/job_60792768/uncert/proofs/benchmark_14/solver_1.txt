----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)
   c -> d
   h(d) -> g(c)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

g: empty set
h: empty set
c: empty set
d: empty set

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)
   c -> d
   h(d) -> g(c)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

g: empty set
h: empty set
c: empty set
d: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(c) = 1
   POL(d) = 0
   POL(g(x_1)) = 0
   POL(h(x_1)) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   c -> d




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)
   h(d) -> g(c)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

g: empty set
h: empty set
c: empty set
d: empty set

----------------------------------------

(3) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)
   h(d) -> g(c)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

g: empty set
h: empty set
c: empty set
d: empty set
Used ordering:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(g(x_1)) =  	[[1]] 	 +  	[[1, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(h(x_1)) =  	[[1]] 	 +  	[[1, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(d) =  	[[1], [1]]
>>>

   <<<
 POL(c) =  	[[0], [0]]
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   h(d) -> g(c)




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

g: empty set
h: empty set

----------------------------------------

(5) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   g(X) -> h(X)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

g: empty set
h: empty set
Used ordering:
Matrix interpretation [MATRO] to (N^2, +, *, >=, >) :

   <<<
 POL(g(x_1)) =  	[[1]] 	 +  	[[1, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

   <<<
 POL(h(x_1)) =  	[[0]] 	 +  	[[1, 1]] 	* 	x_1
>>>

With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   g(X) -> h(X)




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
R is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(8)
YES

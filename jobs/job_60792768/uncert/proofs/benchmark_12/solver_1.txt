Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))
   first(0, Z) -> nil
   first(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> cons(Y, first(X, Z))
   sel(0, cons(X, Z)) -> X
   sel(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> sel(X, Z)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

from: {1}
cons: {1}
s: {1}
first: {1, 2}
0: empty set
nil: empty set
sel: {1, 2}

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRInnermostProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR is orthogonal. By [CS_Inn] we can switch to innermost.

(3) CSDependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Improved CS-DPs [LPAR08] we result in the following initial Q-CSDP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q-restricted context-sensitive dependency pair problem:
The symbols in {from_1, s_1, first_2, sel_2, SEL_2, FROM_1, FIRST_2} are replacing on all positions.
For all symbols f in {cons_2} we have mu(f) = {1}.
The symbols in {U_1} are not replacing on any position.

The ordinary context-sensitive dependency pairs DP_o are:
   SEL(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> SEL(X, Z)

The collapsing dependency pairs are DP_c:
   SEL(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> Z


The hidden terms of R are:

   from(s(x0))
   first(x0, x1)

Every hiding context is built from:
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@391b625d
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@3d08f6a5
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@a46920e

Hence, the new unhiding pairs DP_u are :
   SEL(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> U(Z)
   U(s(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(first(x_0, x_1)) -> U(x_0)
   U(first(x_0, x_1)) -> U(x_1)
   U(from(s(x0))) -> FROM(s(x0))
   U(first(x0, x1)) -> FIRST(x0, x1)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))
   first(0, Z) -> nil
   first(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> cons(Y, first(X, Z))
   sel(0, cons(X, Z)) -> X
   sel(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> sel(X, Z)

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   from(x0)
   first(0, x0)
   first(s(x0), cons(x1, x2))
   sel(0, cons(x0, x1))
   sel(s(x0), cons(x1, x2))

We use the subterm processor [DA_EMMES].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   U(first(x_0, x_1)) -> U(x_0)
   U(first(x_0, x_1)) -> U(x_1)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.

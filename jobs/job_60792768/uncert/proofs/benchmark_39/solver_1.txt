----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   first(0, X) -> nil
   first(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> cons(Y, first(X, Z))
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

first: {1, 2}
0: empty set
nil: empty set
s: {1}
cons: {1}
from: {1}

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   first(0, X) -> nil
   first(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> cons(Y, first(X, Z))
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

first: {1, 2}
0: empty set
nil: empty set
s: {1}
cons: {1}
from: {1}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 0
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(first(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(from(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(nil) = 1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   first(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> cons(Y, first(X, Z))




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   first(0, X) -> nil
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

first: {1, 2}
0: empty set
nil: empty set
s: {1}
cons: {1}
from: {1}

----------------------------------------

(3) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   first(0, X) -> nil
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

first: {1, 2}
0: empty set
nil: empty set
s: {1}
cons: {1}
from: {1}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(0) = 1
   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(first(x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + x_2
   POL(from(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(nil) = 0
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   first(0, X) -> nil




----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

s: {1}
cons: {1}
from: {1}

----------------------------------------

(5) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

s: {1}
cons: {1}
from: {1}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(cons(x_1, x_2)) = x_1
   POL(from(x_1)) = 1 + 2*x_1
   POL(s(x_1)) = x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
R is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

(8)
YES

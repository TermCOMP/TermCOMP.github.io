Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(X) -> cons(X, f(g(X)))
   g(0) -> s(0)
   g(s(X)) -> s(s(g(X)))
   sel(0, cons(X, Y)) -> X
   sel(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> sel(X, Z)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {1}
cons: {1}

0: empty set
s: {1}
sel: {1, 2}

The symbols in {f_1, g_1, s_1, sel_2, G_1, SEL_2, F_1} are replacing on all positions.
For all symbols f in {cons_2} we have mu(f) = {1}.
The symbols in {U_1} are not replacing on any position.

The ordinary context-sensitive dependency pairs DP_o are:
   G(s(X)) -> G(X)

   SEL(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> Z

   f(g(x0))

   SEL(s(X), cons(Y, Z)) -> U(Z)
   U(g(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(f(x_0)) -> U(x_0)

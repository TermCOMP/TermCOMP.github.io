Termination of the given CSR could be proven:

(0) CSR
(1) CSRRRRProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(2) CSR
(3) RisEmptyProof [EQUIVALENT, 0 ms]
(4) YES


----------------------------------------

(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(X), Y) -> f(X, f(g(X), Y))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {1}
g: {1}

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f(g(X), Y) -> f(X, f(g(X), Y))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f: {1}
g: {1}
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(f(x_1, x_2)) = x_1
   POL(g(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f(g(X), Y) -> f(X, f(g(X), Y))




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
R is empty.

----------------------------------------

(3) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.
----------------------------------------

(4)
YES

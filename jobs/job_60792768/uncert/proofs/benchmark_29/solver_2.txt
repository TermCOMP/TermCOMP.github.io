Problem 1: 

(VAR vu95NonEmpty X XS)
(STRATEGY CONTEXTSENSITIVE
(tail 1)
(zeros)
(num0)
(cons 1)
(fSNonEmpty)
)
(RULES
tail(cons(X,XS)) -> XS
zeros -> cons(num0,zeros)
)


Problem 1: 

Innermost Equivalent Processor:
-> Rules:
 tail(cons(X,XS)) -> XS
 zeros -> cons(num0,zeros)
-> The context-sensitive term rewriting system is an orthogonal system. Therefore, innermost cs-termination implies cs-termination.
 

Problem 1: 

Dependency Pairs Processor:
-> Pairs:
 TAIL(cons(X,XS)) -> XS
-> Rules:
 tail(cons(X,XS)) -> XS
 zeros -> cons(num0,zeros)
-> Unhiding Rules:
 zeros -> ZEROS

Problem 1: 

SCC Processor:
-> Pairs:
 TAIL(cons(X,XS)) -> XS
-> Rules:
 tail(cons(X,XS)) -> XS

-> Unhiding rules:
 zeros -> ZEROS
->Strongly Connected Components:
 There is no strongly connected component

The problem is finite.

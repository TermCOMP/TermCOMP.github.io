(0)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f_1(h_0(x)) -> f_1(i_1(x))
   f_1(i_1(x)) -> a_0
   i_1(x) -> h_0(x)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f_1: empty set
h_0: {1}
i_1: empty set
a_0: empty set

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f_1(h_0(x)) -> f_1(i_1(x))
   f_1(i_1(x)) -> a_0
   i_1(x) -> h_0(x)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f_1: empty set
h_0: {1}
i_1: empty set
a_0: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(a_0) = 0
   POL(f_1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(h_0(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(i_1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f_1(i_1(x)) -> a_0




----------------------------------------

(2)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f_1(h_0(x)) -> f_1(i_1(x))
   i_1(x) -> h_0(x)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f_1: empty set
h_0: {1}
i_1: empty set

----------------------------------------

(3) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f_1(h_0(x)) -> f_1(i_1(x))
   i_1(x) -> h_0(x)

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f_1: empty set
h_0: {1}
i_1: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(f_1(x_1)) = 0
   POL(h_0(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(i_1(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   i_1(x) -> h_0(x)

(4)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f_1(h_0(x)) -> f_1(i_1(x))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f_1: empty set
h_0: {1}
i_1: empty set

----------------------------------------

(5) CSRRRRProof (EQUIVALENT)
The following CSR is given: Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   f_1(h_0(x)) -> f_1(i_1(x))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

f_1: empty set
h_0: {1}
i_1: empty set
Used ordering:
Polynomial interpretation [POLO]:

   POL(f_1(x_1)) = x_1
   POL(h_0(x_1)) = 1 + x_1
   POL(i_1(x_1)) = 0
With this ordering the following rules can be removed by the rule removal processor [LPAR04] because they are oriented strictly:

   f_1(h_0(x)) -> f_1(i_1(x))




----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
R is empty.

----------------------------------------

(7) RisEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR R is empty. Hence, termination is trivially proven.

(8)
YES

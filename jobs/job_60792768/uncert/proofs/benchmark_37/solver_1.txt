Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2nd(cons1(X, cons(Y, Z))) -> Y
   2nd(cons(X, X1)) -> 2nd(cons1(X, X1))
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

2nd: {1}
cons1: {1, 2}
cons: {1}
from: {1}
s: {1}

----------------------------------------

(1) CSRInnermostProof (EQUIVALENT)
The CSR is orthogonal. By [CS_Inn] we can switch to innermost.

Obligation:
Context-sensitive rewrite system:
The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2nd(cons1(X, cons(Y, Z))) -> Y
   2nd(cons(X, X1)) -> 2nd(cons1(X, X1))
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The replacement map contains the following entries:

2nd: {1}
cons1: {1, 2}
cons: {1}
from: {1}
s: {1}


Innermost Strategy.

----------------------------------------

(3) CSDependencyPairsProof (EQUIVALENT)
Using Improved CS-DPs [LPAR08] we result in the following initial Q-CSDP problem.
----------------------------------------

(4)
Obligation:
Q-restricted context-sensitive dependency pair problem:
The symbols in {2nd_1, cons1_2, from_1, s_1, 2ND_1, FROM_1} are replacing on all positions.
For all symbols f in {cons_2} we have mu(f) = {1}.
The symbols in {U_1} are not replacing on any position.

The ordinary context-sensitive dependency pairs DP_o are:
   2ND(cons(X, X1)) -> 2ND(cons1(X, X1))

The collapsing dependency pairs are DP_c:
   2ND(cons(X, X1)) -> X1


The hidden terms of R are:

   from(s(x0))

Every hiding context is built from:
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@434d3d71
   aprove.DPFramework.CSDPProblem.QCSDPProblem$1@77ac977c

Hence, the new unhiding pairs DP_u are :
   2ND(cons(X, X1)) -> U(X1)
   U(s(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(s(x0))) -> FROM(s(x0))

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2nd(cons1(X, cons(Y, Z))) -> Y
   2nd(cons(X, X1)) -> 2nd(cons1(X, X1))
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   2nd(cons1(x0, cons(x1, x2)))
   2nd(cons(x0, x1))
   from(x0)


----------------------------------------

(5) QCSDependencyGraphProof (EQUIVALENT)
The approximation of the Context-Sensitive Dependency Graph [LPAR08] contains 1 SCC with 2 less nodes.
The rules 2ND(cons(z0, z1)) -> 2ND(cons1(z0, z1)) and 2ND(cons(x0, x1)) -> 2ND(cons1(x0, x1)) form no chain, because ECap^mu(2ND(cons1(z0, z1))) = 2ND(cons1(z0, x_1)) does not unify with 2ND(cons(x0, x1)). The rules 2ND(cons(z0, z1)) -> 2ND(cons1(z0, z1)) and 2ND(cons(x0, x1)) -> U(x1) form no chain, because ECap^mu(2ND(cons1(z0, z1))) = 2ND(cons1(z0, x_1)) does not unify with 2ND(cons(x0, x1)). 
----------------------------------------

(6)
Obligation:
Q-restricted context-sensitive dependency pair problem:
The symbols in {2nd_1, cons1_2, from_1, s_1} are replacing on all positions.
For all symbols f in {cons_2} we have mu(f) = {1}.
The symbols in {U_1} are not replacing on any position.

The TRS P consists of the following rules:

   U(s(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(x_0)) -> U(x_0)

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2nd(cons1(X, cons(Y, Z))) -> Y
   2nd(cons(X, X1)) -> 2nd(cons1(X, X1))
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   2nd(cons1(x0, cons(x1, x2)))
   2nd(cons(x0, x1))
   from(x0)


----------------------------------------

(7) QCSDPSubtermProof (EQUIVALENT)
We use the subterm processor [DA_EMMES].


The following pairs can be oriented strictly and are deleted.

   U(s(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
   U(from(x_0)) -> U(x_0)
The remaining pairs can at least be oriented weakly.
none
Used ordering:  Combined order from the following AFS and order.
U(x1)  =  x1


Subterm Order

The symbols in {2nd_1, cons1_2, from_1, s_1} are replacing on all positions.
For all symbols f in {cons_2} we have mu(f) = {1}.

The TRS P consists of the following rules:
none

The TRS R consists of the following rules:

   2nd(cons1(X, cons(Y, Z))) -> Y
   2nd(cons(X, X1)) -> 2nd(cons1(X, X1))
   from(X) -> cons(X, from(s(X)))

The set Q consists of the following terms:

   2nd(cons1(x0, cons(x1, x2)))
   2nd(cons(x0, x1))
   from(x0)


----------------------------------------

(9) PIsEmptyProof (EQUIVALENT)
The TRS P is empty. Hence, there is no (P,Q,R,mu)-chain.
